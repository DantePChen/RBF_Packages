    A render layer can be considered as the root of a tree of overrides,

    overrides as leaf nodes.  This base class implements ordering on
    collections and overrides.  An override that is higher-priority will
    supercede the effect of a lower-priority override, and transitively any
    override in a higher-priority partition will supercede the effects of
    any override in a lower-priority partition.
    
    In a given list, an item is higher-priority if it occurs after another
    item (closer to the back) in the same list.  If the items are from
    different lists, we move up the tree hierarchy until we can compare two
    items from the same list.

    are ordered; render layers are not.
