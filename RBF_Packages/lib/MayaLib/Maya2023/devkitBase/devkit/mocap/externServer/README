Overview
--------

This is the README for the Maya motion capture server devkit.  Files in
this directory let you to build two example motion capture servers called
mayaClockServer and externServer.  You can also build two utility functions
calle loopfile and mcp.

Motion capture servers are separate processes that communicate with Maya 
using sockets. A motion capture server creates a number of named channels. 
Each channel is an independent data stream that has a type and a usage. 
The server library (libmocap.a) handles the communications protocol 
between the server and Maya.

In addition, devices may be connected to Maya through a command port.  The
Maya command port allows external programs to send commands to a running
Maya session.  "mcp" is an example program that uses the Maya command 
port interface.


Table of Contents
-----------------

Makefile                The makefile file for the mayaClockServer targets 
                        include:

                                all:    make the mayaClockServer
                                clean:  clean up this directory

                        If Maya is not installed in the default directory 
                        (/usr/autodesk/maya), change the variable BUILD_ROOT
                        to reference $(MAYA_LOCATION) to set the location
                        of the include files and server library

README                  This file

channelParse.README     The readme file for the channelParse config files.

channelParse.c          Config file parser (example) used by externServer
channelParse.h

externServer.c          A server which reads motion capture data from a 
                        file and or a pipe.

loopfile.c              Writes lines from a file at a specified frame rate.
                        Useful when debugging externServer, or to emulate
                        realtime Maya motion capture setups.

mayaClockServer.c       An example motion capture server that expresses
                        the system time as three rotational channels--one
                        each for the rotations of the hour, second, and 
                        minute hands.  (See mayaClockDemo)

mcp.c++                 A simple shell for sending commands to a Maya
                        commandPort.  See commandPort in the online command
                        documentation.

rotTest.cfg             Example externServer config file
rotTest.txt             Example data file for externServer or loopfile
rotTestComp.cfg         Example for rotTest.txt treating each column as
                        a scalar channel.
