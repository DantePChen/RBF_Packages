Utility to contain the DG state information captured by a correctness
analysis. It reads the information from a file and provides analysis
tools, such as comparison.

State information is in JSON format for easy storage, parsing, and comparison.
Data is stored in a method that provides a parsing clue for what types of
values are stored on the plug:
    isinstance(VALUE, numbers.Number) : Simple numeric value
    type(VALUE) is list : List of simple numeric values (matrix or vector)
    type(VALUE) is dict : Named data type, with a named parser
