"""
The apply override nodes that may be inserted in a shading network are divided into two families:
 - absolute override
 - relative override
and they can output the following types:
 - float, float2, float3
 - int, int2, int3
 - enum (absolute only)
 - bool (absolute only)
 - string (absolute only)
and they can be enabled or not.

Absolute overrides have the following inputs:
 - an original value (original)
 - an override value (attrValue)
 - an enabled bool (enabled)
In pseudo code, their output would be evaluated as:
  out = enabled? attrValue : original;
  
Relative overrides have the following inputs:
 - an original value (original)
 - a multiply value (multiply)
 - an offset value (offset)
 - an enabled bool (enabled)
 In pseudo code, their output would be evaluated as:
  out = enabled? original * multiply + offset : original;

Plugin renderers need to translate these nodes in order for their shading network to be evaluated accurately.

IMPORTANT:

Apply override nodes are connected to override nodes.
Override nodes define the override parameters (attrValue (absolute), offset, multiply (relative)).
Apply overrides are a specific application of the override on a specific target node, since an override can apply to one or more targets. They read the 
parameters from the override nodes and these parameters are readable AND writable attributes (in and out).
They are NOT computed by the override node but simply "forwarded" to the apply override nodes.
They may have SOURCE CONNECTIONS or be KEYED though. This means that the override nodes don't need to be translated
since they do not compute the outputs. But the override node's sources must be translated and connected to the translated apply override 
in order to be well evaluated.

Example:

        This method will be called by Maya when it detects changes in the attribute values of nodes in the shading network.
        If this method returns True, Maya will assume that the change means that a new configuration of the total fragment graph
        is necessary and it will trigger a rebuild of the complete shading effect. This will cause fragmentName() to be invoked
        again at which point a different fragment name could be returned.
        
        For example, if a texture node has multiple modes, each implemented with a different fragment, then a change to the active
        mode would require the shading effect to be rebuilt in order to switch which fragment is used.
        
        The plug parameter passed in is Maya's best attempt at informing the implementation of what changed. However due to the
