Derived classes will handle evaluator-specific information, this
one just handles the information that is common to all evaluators.

The object is set up to use the Python "with" syntax as follows:

    class MyEvaluatorManager(EvaluatorManager):
        ...

    from maya.debug.MyEvaluatorManager import MyEvaluatorManager
    with MyEvaluatorManager() as mgr:
        mgr.setMode( someMode )

That will ensure the original states are all restored.

If you need different control you can manually complete the sequence:

    mgr = MyEvaluatorManager()
    mgr.save_state()
    mgr.setMode( someMode )
    mgr.restore_state()
