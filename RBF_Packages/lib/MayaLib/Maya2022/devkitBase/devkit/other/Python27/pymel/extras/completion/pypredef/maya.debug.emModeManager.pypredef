"""
Helper class that maintains the EM mode information. Given a string
to specifies an EM mode combination (type +/- evaluators) it will
handle the details regarding translating the mode description into
actions and turning the mode on and off.

String syntax is an abbreviated evaluation mode followed by zero or
more evaluator directives. Regex is [MODE]{[+-]EVALUATOR}*[/NODETYPE

Examples:
    dg            : Turn the EM off and go back to DG mode
    ems           : Turn the EM on and put it into serial mode
    emp           : Turn the EM on and put it into parallel mode
    emp+null      : Turn the EM on and enable the null evaluator
    emp-dynamics  : Turn the EM on and disable the dynamics evaluator
    emp-dynamics+deformer
                  : Turn the EM on, disable the dynamics evaluator, and
                    enable the deformer evaluator
    +cache        : Retain the current EM mode, enable the cache evaluator
    ems+null/transform : Turn the EM on to serial mode and enable the null evaluator
                         for all transform node types.

Calling the setMode() method will put the EM into the named mode.
Calling it again will exit that mode and put it into the new mode,
including unloading any plugins that had to be loaded. Destruction
or reassignment of the manager will restore the EM to the state it
had just before the first time the mode was set.

The node types enabled by any mentioned evaluators is remembered and
restored on exit. Any evaluators not explicitly appearing in the
evaluator directive list will not have its state remembered.

The plugin loading is not magic, it's a hardcoded list in this file.
Update it if you want to handle any new plugins.

The object is set up to use the Python "with" syntax as follows:

    with emModeManager() as mgr:
        mgr.setMode( someMode )

That will ensure the original states are all restored. There's no other
reliable way to do it in Python. If you need different syntax you can
manually call the method to complete the sequence:

    mgr = emModeManager()
    mgr.setMode( someMode )
    mgr.restore_state()

        remember just the things that were changed.
