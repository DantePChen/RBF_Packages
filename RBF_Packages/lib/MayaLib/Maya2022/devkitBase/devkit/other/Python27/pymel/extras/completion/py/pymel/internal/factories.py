        Register a new virtual class
        
        Allows a user to create their own subclasses of leaf PyMEL node classes,
        which are returned by `general.PyNode` and all other pymel commands.
        
        The process is fairly simple:
            1.  Subclass a PyNode class.  Be sure that it is a leaf class,
                meaning that it represents an actual Maya node type and not an
                abstract type higher up in the hierarchy.
            2.  Add an _isVirtual classmethod that accepts two arguments: an
                MObject/MDagPath instance for the current object, and its name.
                It should return True if the current object meets the
                requirements to become the virtual subclass, or else False.
            3.  Add optional _preCreate, _create, and _postCreate methods.  For
                more on these, see below
            4.  Register your subclass by calling
                factories.registerVirtualClass. If the _isVirtual callback
                requires the name of the object, set the keyword argument
                nameRequired to True. The object's name is not always
                immediately available and may take an extra calculation to
                retrieve, so if nameRequired is not set the name argument
                passed to your callback could be None.
        
        The creation of custom nodes may be customized with the use of
        isVirtual, preCreate, create, and postCreate functions; these are
        functions (or classmethods) which are called before / during / after
        creating the node.
        
        The isVirtual method is required - it is the callback used on instances
        of the base (ie, 'real') objects to determine whether they should be
        considered an instance of this virtual class. It's input is an MObject
        and an optional name (if nameRequired is set to True). It should return
        True to indicate that the given object is 'of this class', False
        otherwise. PyMEL code should not be used inside the callback, only API
        and maya.cmds. Keep in mind that once your new type is registered, its
        test will be run every time a node of its parent type is returned as a
        PyMEL node class, so be sure to keep your tests simple and fast.
        
        The preCreate function is called prior to node creation and gives you a
        chance to modify the kwargs dictionary; they are fed the kwargs fed to
        the creation command, and return either 1 or 2 dictionaries; the first
        dictionary is the one actually passed to the creation command; the
        second, if present, is passed to the postCreate command.
        
        The create method can be used to override the 'default' node creation
        command;  it is given the kwargs given on node creation (possibly
        altered by the preCreate), and must return the string name of the
        created node. (...or any another type of object (such as an MObject),
        as long as the postCreate and class.__init__ support it.)
        
        The postCreate function is called after creating the new node, and
        gives you a chance to modify it.  The method is passed the PyNode of
        the newly created node, as well as the second dictionary returned from
        the preCreate function as kwargs (if it was returned). You can use
        PyMEL code here, but you should avoid creating any new nodes.
        
        By default, any method named '_isVirtual', '_preCreateVirtual',
        '_createVirtual', or '_postCreateVirtual' on the class is used; if
        present, these must be classmethods or staticmethods.
        
        Other methods / functions may be used by passing a string or callable
        to the preCreate / postCreate kwargs.  If a string, then the method
        with that name on the class is used; it should be a classmethod or
        staticmethod present at the time it is registered.
        
        The value None may also be passed to any of these args (except isVirtual)
        to signal that no function is to be used for these purposes.
        
        If more than one subclass is registered for a node type, the registered
        callbacks will be run newest to oldest until one returns True. If no
        test returns True, then the standard node class is used. Also, for each
        base node type, if there is already a virtual class registered with the
        same name and module, then it is removed. (This helps alleviate
        registered callbacks from piling up if, for instance, a module is
        reloaded.)
        
        Overriding methods of PyMEL base classes should be performed with care,
        because certain methods are used internally and altering their results
        may cause PyMEL to error or behave unpredictably.  This is particularly
        true for special methods like __setattr__, __getattr__, __setstate__,
        __getstate__, etc.  Some methods are considered too dangerous to modify,
        and registration will fail if the user defines an override for them;
        this set includes __init__, __new__, and __str__.
        
        For a usage example, see examples/customClasses.py

    """
    Register a new virtual class
    
    Allows a user to create their own subclasses of leaf PyMEL node classes,
    which are returned by `general.PyNode` and all other pymel commands.
    
    The process is fairly simple:
        1.  Subclass a PyNode class.  Be sure that it is a leaf class,
            meaning that it represents an actual Maya node type and not an
            abstract type higher up in the hierarchy.
        2.  Add an _isVirtual classmethod that accepts two arguments: an
            MObject/MDagPath instance for the current object, and its name.
            It should return True if the current object meets the
            requirements to become the virtual subclass, or else False.
        3.  Add optional _preCreate, _create, and _postCreate methods.  For
            more on these, see below
        4.  Register your subclass by calling
            factories.registerVirtualClass. If the _isVirtual callback
            requires the name of the object, set the keyword argument
            nameRequired to True. The object's name is not always
            immediately available and may take an extra calculation to
            retrieve, so if nameRequired is not set the name argument
            passed to your callback could be None.
    
    The creation of custom nodes may be customized with the use of
    isVirtual, preCreate, create, and postCreate functions; these are
    functions (or classmethods) which are called before / during / after
    creating the node.
    
    The isVirtual method is required - it is the callback used on instances
    of the base (ie, 'real') objects to determine whether they should be
    considered an instance of this virtual class. It's input is an MObject
    and an optional name (if nameRequired is set to True). It should return
    True to indicate that the given object is 'of this class', False
    otherwise. PyMEL code should not be used inside the callback, only API
    and maya.cmds. Keep in mind that once your new type is registered, its
    test will be run every time a node of its parent type is returned as a
    PyMEL node class, so be sure to keep your tests simple and fast.
    
    The preCreate function is called prior to node creation and gives you a
    chance to modify the kwargs dictionary; they are fed the kwargs fed to
    the creation command, and return either 1 or 2 dictionaries; the first
    dictionary is the one actually passed to the creation command; the
    second, if present, is passed to the postCreate command.
    
    The create method can be used to override the 'default' node creation
    command;  it is given the kwargs given on node creation (possibly
    altered by the preCreate), and must return the string name of the
    created node. (...or any another type of object (such as an MObject),
    as long as the postCreate and class.__init__ support it.)
    
    The postCreate function is called after creating the new node, and
    gives you a chance to modify it.  The method is passed the PyNode of
    the newly created node, as well as the second dictionary returned from
    the preCreate function as kwargs (if it was returned). You can use
    PyMEL code here, but you should avoid creating any new nodes.
    
    By default, any method named '_isVirtual', '_preCreateVirtual',
    '_createVirtual', or '_postCreateVirtual' on the class is used; if
    present, these must be classmethods or staticmethods.
    
    Other methods / functions may be used by passing a string or callable
    to the preCreate / postCreate kwargs.  If a string, then the method
    with that name on the class is used; it should be a classmethod or
    staticmethod present at the time it is registered.
    
    The value None may also be passed to any of these args (except isVirtual)
    to signal that no function is to be used for these purposes.
    
    If more than one subclass is registered for a node type, the registered
    callbacks will be run newest to oldest until one returns True. If no
    test returns True, then the standard node class is used. Also, for each
    base node type, if there is already a virtual class registered with the
    same name and module, then it is removed. (This helps alleviate
    registered callbacks from piling up if, for instance, a module is
    reloaded.)
    
    Overriding methods of PyMEL base classes should be performed with care,
    because certain methods are used internally and altering their results
    may cause PyMEL to error or behave unpredictably.  This is particularly
    true for special methods like __setattr__, __getattr__, __setstate__,
    __getstate__, etc.  Some methods are considered too dangerous to modify,
    and registration will fail if the user defines an override for them;
    this set includes __init__, __new__, and __str__.
    
    For a usage example, see examples/customClasses.py
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    nameRequired : `bool`
        True if the _isVirtual callback requires the string name to operate
        on. The object's name is not always immediately avaiable and may
        take an extra calculation to retrieve.
    isVirtual: `str` or callable
        the function to determine whether an MObject is an instance of this
        class; should take an MObject and name, returns True / or False
    preCreate: `str` or callable
        the function used to modify kwargs before being passed to the
        creation function
    create: `str` or callable
        function to use instead of the standard node creation method;
        takes whatever args are given to the cl
    postCreate: `str` or callable
        the function used to modify the PyNode after it is created.

    Regarding Undo
    --------------
    
    The API provides many methods which are pairs -- one sets a value
    while the other one gets the value.  the naming convention of these
    methods follows a fairly consistent pattern.  so what I did was
    determine all the get and set pairs, which I can use to automatically
    register api undo items:  prior to setting something, we first *get*
    it's existing value, which we can later use to reset when undo is
    triggered.
    
    This API undo is only for PyMEL methods which are derived from API
    methods.  it's not meant to be used with plugins.  and since it just
    piggybacks maya's MEL undo system, it won't get cross-mojonated.
    
    Take `MFnTransform.setTranslation`, for example. PyMEL provides a wrapped copy of this as
    `Transform.setTranslation`.   when pymel.Transform.setTranslation is
    called, here's what happens in relation to undo:
    
        #. process input args, if any
        #. call MFnTransform.getTranslation() to get the current translation.
        #. append to the api undo queue, with necessary info to undo/redo
           later (the current method, the current args, and the current
           translation)
        #. call MFnTransform.setTranslation() with the passed args
        #. process result and return it
