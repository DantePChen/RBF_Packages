class RenderSetupSelectCmd(_MPxCommand):
    """
    Command that can be used to select render setup elements as well as to
    query the elements in the render setup selection.
    
    Five optional flags can be used with this command:
    
    -additive (-a) adds elements to the selection (without clearing it)
    
    -deselect (-d) removes elements from the current selection
    
    -renderLayers is a query only flag that specifies that renderLayers 
    should be returned as part of the query
    
    -collections is a query only flag that specifies that collections should 
    be returned as part of the query
    
    -overrides is a query only flag that specifies that overrides should be 
    returned as part of the query
    
    By default the selection is cleared before selecting elements. Also the
    additive and deselect flags cannot be used in conjunction.
    
    Sample Usage:
    // Select "renderSetupLayer1" and "renderSetupLayer2" 
    renderSetupSelect "renderSetupLayer1" "renderSetupLayer2"
    
    // Add "renderSetupLayer1" and "renderSetupLayer2" to the selection
    renderSetupSelect -additive "renderSetupLayer1" "renderSetupLayer2"
    
    // Deselect "renderSetupLayer1" and "renderSetupCollection2" from the selection
    renderSetupSelect -deselect "renderSetupLayer1" "renderSetupCollection2"
    
    // Query the selected render setup items
    renderSetupSelect -query

    // overrides
