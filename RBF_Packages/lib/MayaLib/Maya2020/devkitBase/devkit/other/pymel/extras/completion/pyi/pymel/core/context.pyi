    This command creates a context that can be used for associating geometry to

    selected first then geometry associated with the shading group are highlighted.
    Subsequent selections result in assignments. Specifying -shadingCentric false
    means that the geometry is to be selected first.  The shading group associated

        selection set, causes the first selection after the computation of the previous
        result to be shiftselection, unless a modifier key is pressed.  Default is
        false. Flags for each selection set.  These flags are multi-use.

        at the time you complete it.  You could then delete some of the items in that
        list and end up with invalid items in one or more of your selection sets.  If
        this flag is set, those items will be detected and ignored.  You will never know
        it happened.  Its as if they were never selected in the first place, except that
        your selection set now does not have as many items as it may need.  If this flag
        is not set, you will get a warning and your final command callback script will
        likely not execute because of an error condition.
