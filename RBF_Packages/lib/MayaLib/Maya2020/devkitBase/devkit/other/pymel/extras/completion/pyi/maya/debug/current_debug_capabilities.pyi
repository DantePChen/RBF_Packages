"""
Utility script to scour the known debugging commands and dump a formatted collection of
information on what capabilities are available. Done in a backwards compatible manner
so that it can be run on earlier versions to find capabilities retroactively.

    from maya.debug.current_debug_capabilities import current_debug_capabilities
    print current_debug_capabilities( None )

Output is formatted as JSON for easy parsing for document creation. Here's a simple
example for the dbtrace command, which initially only supported the "compute" keyword
in customer cuts.

{
    "debugging" :
    {
        "dbtrace" :
        {
            "help" : "Synopsis: dbtrace [flags]Flags:   -q -query   -f -filter   String   -i -info       -k -keyword  String (multi-use) (Query Arg Optional)   -l -level    UnsignedInt (multi-use) (Query Arg Mandatory)   -m -mark       -o -output   String -off -           -t -title    String  -tm -timed    on|off   -v -verbose Command Type: Command",

                "compute" : "High level trace of the compute path."
            }
        }
    }

For any section requiring commands not available in the current cut an
abbreviated output is provided:

    "debugging" :
    {
        "dbtrace" : { "help" : "The dbtrace command is not available in this cut" }
