/// \def PEPTIDE_DEPRECATED(REASON)
///
/// \brief Macro indicating that a declaration is deprecated
///
/// The macro can be used to indicate that a declaration is deprecated and
/// shouldn't be used anymore in new code. The deprecated declaration could be
/// a function or a class, for example. The macro also allows one to provide an
/// explanation concerning the deprecation.
///
/// For example:
///
/// \code{.cpp}
///     #ifndef DOXYGEN
///        PEPTIDE_DEPRECATED("MAYA-1234 Use newerAndBetterFunction() instead.")
///     #endif
///        void aFunctionNowObsolete();
/// \endcode
///
/// \warning The DOXYGEN guard is necessary to avoid the following bogus
///          Doxygen warning: _error: Found ';' while parsing initializer list!
///          (doxygen could be confused by a macro call without semicolon)
///          (warning treated as error, aborting now)_
///
/// \note The deprecation warning is disabled on MSC because it leads to an
///       error being reported which causes the entire build to fail. This is
///       due to the presence of the "warning as errors (/WX)" flag. There
///       doesn't seem to be a way to turn off the warning as errors for a
///       single specific warning.
