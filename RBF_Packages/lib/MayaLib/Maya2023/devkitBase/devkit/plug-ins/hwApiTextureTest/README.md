HwApiTextureTest plugin
===================================================

Introduction
------------

Demonstrates loading and saving of textures via MHWRender::MTextureManager with optional VP preview.

Building the plug-in
-----------------------------

Before building the hwApiTextureTest plug-in, you will need to install glew.
* See "Building a plug-in with glew" section of the main devkit README.

The OpenGL requirements are the same as other maya plugins.

Afterwards, you can use either the Makefile, the MSVC project or the
Xcode project to build this plug-in using the procedure normally used
for building any other devkit plug-in.
