    TlightCmd is the base class for other light commands. The ambientLight command

    The default behaviour is to create a new ambientlight. This is the commmand that
    instantiates an ambientLight or edits the parameters of an existing one.
    TambientLightCmd inherits from TlightCmd which defines common flags like
    intensity, colour etc. See TlightCmd for a global picture of the light commands.
    Note that the flag fAmbientLightUsed indicates whether the command uses any
    ambient specific flags. That is, if a command doesn't use flags defined here,
    the boolean fAmbientLightUsed is set to false and thus the undo/redo information
    is not saved at this level. TambientLightCmd behaves like any other command, it
    has flags, saves undo information etc. the only slightly different behaviour is
    that it calls up to TlightCmd to complete the functionality of the command.
    Example      parseArgs:  TambientLightCmd defines ambientLight specific
    parameters like -ambientShade however, several other parameters are available in
    TlightCmd such as -intensity etc.  So when parsing the arguments, a call is made

    - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL
        version of the callback is of the form: global proc string[] callbackName(string
        $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that is
        transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array
        describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined
        drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
        CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3
        == CTRL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the
        callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
        argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def
        callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The values of these arguments are
        the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the
        callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the
        string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format
        operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys
        dragControl, x, y, modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other
        values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s
        %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
    - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above
        the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form: global proc
        callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x,
        int $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the
        drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined
        message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the
        callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python,
        it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended
        way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the
        Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the
        same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback
        in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will
        have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.
        The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the

        The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the
        control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-
        out indicating it is disabled.
    
    - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

        would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that

    - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
        Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be
        obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by
        some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
        window is invisible or iconified.
    
    - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it
        take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
    
    - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
        Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should
        not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of
        this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
    - node : n                       (PyNode)        [create]
        Specifies the name of the newRamp texture node this port will represent.

        right mouse button menu.
    
    - selectedColorControl : sc      (unicode)       [create,edit]
        Set the name of the control (if any) which is to be used to show the color of
        the currently selected entry in the ramp. This control will automatically update

        default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName
        is set as the current template.
    
    - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory
        structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
    
    - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL
        version of the callback is of the form: global proc string[] callbackName(string
        $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that is
        transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array
        describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined
        drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
        CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3
        == CTRL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the
        callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
        argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def
        callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The values of these arguments are
        the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the
        callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the
        string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format
        operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys
        dragControl, x, y, modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other
        values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s
        %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
    - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above
        the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form: global proc
        callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x,
        int $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the
        drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined
        message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the
        callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python,
        it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended
        way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the
        Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the
        same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback
        in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will
        have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.
        The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the
        other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
        '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
    - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the

    The imagePlane command allows querying of various properties of         an image
    plane and any movie in use by the image plane. It also supports         creating
    and edit.         The object passed to the command may either be an imagePlane
    node,         or a camera, in which case the command uses the image plane
    attached         to the camera (if any). If no object is passed in, the current
    selection is used.         Currently, most movie related queries work only on 64
    bit Windows systems.
    
    Flags:

        attached to (free image plane), it will return an empty string. When edit, it
        will make the image plane attach to the new specified camera. If the camera
        given is invalid, it will do nothing. When the image plane is attached to a
        camera, the image plane's transform node will be set identity. The detach

        Get or set the window's snapshot mode.
    
    - stateString : sts              (bool)          [query]
        Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the
        current editor state. The returned command string uses the string variable
        $editorName in place of a specific name.
    
    - stereo : s                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Puts the editor into stereo image mode.  The effective resolution of the output
        image is twice the size of the horizontal size. The orientation of the images
        can be set using the stereoOrientation flag.
    
    - stereoImageOrientation : sio   (unicode, unicode) [create,query,edit]
        Specifies the orientation of stereo camera renders.  The first argument
        specifies the orientation value for the firstleft image and the second argument
        specifies the orientation value for the right image. The orientation values are
        'normal', the image appears as seen throught he camera, or 'mirrored', the image
        is mirrored horizontally.
    
    - stereoMode : sm                (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Specifies how the image is displayed in the view.  By default the stereo is
        rendered with a side by side image.  The rendered image is a single image that
        is twice the size of a normal image, 'both'. Users can also choose to display as
        'redcyan', 'redcyanlum', 'leftonly', 'rightonly', or 'stereo'.  both - displays
        both the left and right redcyan - displays the images as a red/cyan pair.
        redcyanlum - displays the luminance of the images as a red/cyan pair. leftonly -
        displays the left side only rightonly - displays the right side only stereo -
        mode that supports Crystal Eyes(tm) or Zscreen (tm) renders
    
    - toggle : tgl                   (bool)          [create,query,edit]

    - unParent : up                  (bool)          [create,edit]
        Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used
        in query mode.
    
    - unlockMainConnection : ulk     (bool)          [create,edit]
        Unlocks the mainConnection, effectively restoring the original mainConnection
        (if it is still available), and dynamic updates.
    
    - updateMainConnection : upd     (bool)          [create,edit]
        Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection,
        but preserves the lock state.
    
    - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
        Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
    - viewImageCount : vic           (int)           [create,query,edit]
        The render editor has the capability to render multiple cameras within a single
        view. This is different from image binning where an image is saved. Multiple
        image views are useful for comparing two different camera renders side-by-side.
        The viewImageCount flag tells the editor that it should prepare its internal
        image storage mechanism for a given number of views.
    
    - viewTransformName : vtn        (unicode)       [query,edit]
        Sets/gets the view transform to be applied if color management is enabled in the
        current view.
    
    - writeImage : wi                (unicode)       [edit]
        write the current Editor Image to disk                  Flag can have multiple
        arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    This command creates a checkBox that controls whether a shadingGroup is
    connected/disconnected from the defaultLightList.
    
    Flags:
    - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
    - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
        The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green,
        and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When
        setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
        enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
    - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
        Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and
        added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as
        default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName
        is set as the current template.
    
    - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory
        structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
    
    - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL
        version of the callback is of the form: global proc string[] callbackName(string
        $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that is
        transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array
        describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined
        drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
        CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3
        == CTRL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the
        callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
        argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def
        callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The values of these arguments are
        the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the
        callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the
        string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format
        operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys
        dragControl, x, y, modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other
        values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s
        %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
    - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above
        the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form: global proc
        callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x,
        int $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the
        drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined
        message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the
        callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python,
        it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended
        way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the
        Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the
        same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback
        in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will
        have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.
        The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the
        other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
        '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
    - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the
        control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-

        If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select
        values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag
        would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that
        get it by default, like Edit and List controls
    
    - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]

        not overruled by parent layout conditions.
    
    - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
        The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green,
        and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
    
    - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
        Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be
        obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by
        some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
        window is invisible or iconified.
    
    - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,edit]

    - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it
        take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
    
    - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
        Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should
        not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of
        this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
    - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
        Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
    
    - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]

    - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
        Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
    
    - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's
        right mouse button menu.
    
    - shadingGroup : sg              (PyNode)        [create,edit]
        The shading group that is to be connected/disconnected from the
        defaultLightList.

        Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
    - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.
        Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state
        of its parent layout(s).
    
    - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
        Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
    
    - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
        The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not
        overruled by parent layout conditions.                  Flag can have multiple
        arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

        A real lens normally contains a diaphragm or other stop which blocks some of the
        light that would otherwise pass through it. This stop is usually approximately
        round, and its diameter as seen from the front of the lens is called the lens
        diameter. The lens diameter is often described by its relation to the focal
        length of the lens. A lens whose diameter is one-eighth its local length is said
        to have an F-stop of 8. This is an optical property of the lens.

    - filmFit : ff                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        This describes how the digital image (in pixels) relates to the film back. Since
        the film back is defined in terms of real numbers with some arbitrary film
        aspect, and the digital image is defined in integer pixels with an equally
        arbitrary (and different) resolution, relating the two can get complicated.
        There are 4 choices: horizontal In this case the digital image is made to fit
        the film back exactly in the horizontal direction. This then gives each pixel a
        horizontal size = (film back width) / (horizontal resolution). The pixel height
        is then = (pixel width) / (pixel aspect ratio). Now that the pixel has a size,
        resolution gives us a complete image. That image will match the film back
        exactly in width. It will almost never match in height, either being too tall or
        too short. By playing with the numbers you can get it pretty close
        though.verticalThis is the same idea as horizontal fit, only applied vertically.
        Thus the digital image will match the film back exactly in height, but miss in
        width.fillThis is a convenience item. The system calculates both horizontal and
        vertical fits and then applies the one that makes the digital image larger than
        the film back.overscanOverscanning the film gate in the camera view allows us to
        choreograph action outside of the frustum from within the camera view without
        having to resort to a dolly or zoom. This feature is also essential for
        animating image planes.
    
    - filmFitOffset : ffo            (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Since we know from the above that the digital image may not match the film back
        exactly, we now have the question of how to position one relative to the other.
        Thus fit offset. Normally the centers are aligned. Fit offset lets you move the
        smaller image within the larger one. Specify the distance for film offset
        (inches).
    
    - filmRollOrder : fro            (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Specifies how the roll is applied with respect to the pivot value. Rotate-
        TranslateThe film back is first rotated then translated by the pivot point value

        value.
    
    - filmRollValue : frv            (float)         [create,query,edit]
        This specifies that amount of rotation around the film back. The roll value is
        specified in degrees. The rotation occurs around the specified pivot point. This
        value is used to compute a film roll matrix, which is a component of the post-
        projection matrix.
    
    - filmTranslateH : fth           (float)         [create,query,edit]

    - focalLength : fl               (float)         [create,query,edit]
        This is the distance along the lens axis between the lens and the film plane
        when focal distanceis infinitely large. This is an optical property of the lens.
        This double precision parameter is always specified in millimeters.

    - horizontalFieldOfView : hfv    (float)         [create,query,edit]
        This is the film back width as seen by the lens when focused at infinity (ie.,
        focal length away) measured as an angle. Note that it has nothing to do with
        pixels or the digital image or any aspects. Angle of view is a derived field,
        that is, it is not used internally by Alias and can be completely determined
        from other information. It is included as a convenience for the user. Its
        derivation is aov = 2 \* atan( fbw / (2 \* f) ) where aovis the angle of view,
        fbwis the film back width and fis the focal length.
    
    - horizontalFilmAperture : hfa   (float)         [create,query,edit]
        The horizontal width of the camera's film plane. The camera's film is located on
        the film plane. The extent of the film which will be exposed to an image of the
        scene in front of the lens is limited to a rectangular area described by the
        film back. This double precision parameter is always specified in inches.
    
    - horizontalFilmOffset : hfo     (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Horizontal offset from the center of the film back. Normally the film back will
        be centered on the lens axis. However, this need not be so. Film offset is the
        displacement of the center of the film back from the lens axis, also measured in
        inches. Note that offsetting the film back will distort the image, but will not
        alter the focus. This double precision parameter is always specified in inches.
    
    - horizontalPan : hpn            (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Horizontal 2D camera pan (inches)
    
    - horizontalRollPivot : hrp      (float)         [create,query,edit]
        The horizontal pivot point from the center of the film back. The pivot point is
        used during rotation of the film back.  The pivot is the point where the
        rotation occurs around. This double precision parameter corresponds to the
        normalized viewport. This value is a part of the post projection matrix.
    
    - horizontalShake : hs           (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Another horizontal offset from the center of the film back, which can be used
        and stored on the camera in addition to the horizonal film offset attribute.
        This allows for film-based camera shake internal to the camera.  This works in
        exactly the same units and coordinates that the film offset attribute does. The
        effect of this attribute is toggled by the shake enabled attribute.
    
    - journalCommand : jc            (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Journal interactive camera commands. Commands can be undone when a camera is
        journaled.
    
    - lensSqueezeRatio : lsr         (float)         [create,query,edit]
        This is presently just an information field in the camera editor is meant to
        convey the horizontal distortion of the anamorphic lens normally used with some
        film formats. If it were used, it would do something like pixel aspect. Remember
        however that lens distortion (intentional or not) is slightly different than the
        output hardware's quantization. The fact that a netdistortion parameter could be
        used for both may or may not confuse the issue.

def layeredShaderPort(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a 3dPort that displays an image representing the layered
    shader node specified.
    
    Flags:
    - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
    - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
        The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green,
        and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When
        setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
        enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
    - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
        Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and
        added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as
        default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName
        is set as the current template.
    
    - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory
        structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
    
    - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL
        version of the callback is of the form: global proc string[] callbackName(string
        $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that is
        transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array
        describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined
        drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
        CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3
        == CTRL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the
        callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
        argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def
        callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The values of these arguments are
        the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the
        callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the
        string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format
        operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys
        dragControl, x, y, modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other
        values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s
        %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
    - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above
        the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form: global proc
        callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x,
        int $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the
        drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined
        message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the
        callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python,
        it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended
        way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the
        Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the
        same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback
        in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will
        have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.
        The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the
        other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
        '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
    - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the
        control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-
        out indicating it is disabled.
    
    - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Enables the background color of the control.
    
    - enableKeyboardFocus : ekf      (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select
        values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag
        would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that
        get it by default, like Edit and List controls
    
    - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]

        The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is
        not overruled by parent layout conditions.
    
    - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
        The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green,
        and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
    
    - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
        Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be
        obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by
        some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
        window is invisible or iconified.
    
    - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it
        take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
    
    - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
        Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should
        not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of
        this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
    - node : n                       (PyNode)        [create]
        Specifies the name of the newLayeredShader node this port will represent.

    - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
        Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
    
    - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's
        right mouse button menu.
    
    - selectedColorControl : scc     (unicode)       [create]
        Specifies the name of the UI-control that represents the currently selected
        layer's color.

        Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
    - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.
        Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state
        of its parent layout(s).
    
    - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
        Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
    
    - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
        The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not
        overruled by parent layout conditions.                  Flag can have multiple
        arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    dropped onto other controls (e.g., HyperShade), the command will be executed and
    the return string will be used as the name of a dropped node.
    
    Flags:
    - align : al                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        The label alignment.  Alignment values are left, right, and center. By default,
        the label is aligned center. Currently only available when -st/style is set to
        iconAndTextCentered.
    
    - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
    - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
        The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green,
        and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When
        setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
        enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
    - command : c                    (script)        [create,query,edit]
        Command executed when the control is pressed. The command should return a string
        which will be used to facilitate node drag and drop.
    
    - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
        Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and
        added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as
        default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName
        is set as the current template.
    
    - disabledImage : di             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image
        specified with the i/imageflag. This is a Windows only flag.
    
    - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory
        structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
    
    - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL
        version of the callback is of the form: global proc string[] callbackName(string
        $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that is
        transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array
        describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined
        drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
        CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3
        == CTRL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the
        callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
        argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def
        callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The values of these arguments are
        the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the
        callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the
        string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format
        operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys
        dragControl, x, y, modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other
        values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s
        %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
    - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above
        the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form: global proc
        callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x,
        int $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the
        drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined
        message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the
        callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python,
        it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended
        way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the
        Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the
        same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback
        in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will
        have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.
        The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the
        other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
        '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
    - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the
        control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-
        out indicating it is disabled.
    
    - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Enables the background color of the control.
    
    - enableKeyboardFocus : ekf      (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select
        values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag
        would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that
        get it by default, like Edit and List controls
    
    - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
        Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

        not overruled by parent layout conditions.
    
    - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
        The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green,

    - image : i                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        If you are not providing images with different sizes then you may use this flag
        for the control's image. If the iconOnlystyle is set, the icon will be scaled to
        the size of the control.
    
    - image1 : i1                    (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        First of three possible icons. The icon that best fits the current size of the

    - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
        Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be
        obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by
        some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
        window is invisible or iconified.
    
    - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

    - ltVersion : lt                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        This flag is used to specify the Maya LT version that this control feature was
        introduced, if the version flag is not specified, or if the version flag is
        specified but its argument is different. This value is only used by Maya LT, and
        otherwise ignored. The argument should be given as a string of the version
        number (e.g. 2013, 2014). Currently only accepts major version numbers (e.g.
        2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be given as 2014).

    - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
        Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should
        not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of
        this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
    - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
        Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

    Derived from mel command `maya.cmds.nodeIconButton`
    """
    pass
def prepareRender(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command is used to register, manage and invoke render traversals. Render
    traversals are used to configure a scene to prepare it for rendering. This
    command has special support for scene assembly nodes.  To render scene assembly
    nodes, a rendering traversal can activate an appropriate representation, for
    each assembly node in the scene.  When rendering is done, this command can
    correspondingly restore the representation that was active before rendering on
    each assembly. Render traversals are grouped into traversal sets.  A render
    traversal set includes callbacks, or render traversals, for one or more of the
    following steps of rendering, ordered by decreasing level of granularity. A
    render traversal callback is an arbitrary script, either MEL or Python, that can
    transform the Maya scene for rendering purposes. preRenderTraversal run once per
    render, before any rendering is performed.postRenderTraversal run once per
    render, after all rendering has been performed.preRenderLayerTraversal run
    before rendering each render layer.postRenderLayerTraversal run after rendering
    each render layer.preRenderFrameTraversal run before rendering each
    frame.postRenderFrameTraversal run after rendering each frame.During a render
    view or batch render, Maya will run the render traversals from the same
    traversal set, the default traversal set.  Traversal sets are named, so multiple
    traversal sets can be registered with this command, and the default render
    traversal set can be switched to any one of these registered traversal sets.
    When changing the default traversal set, the different render traversal
    callbacks (preRender, preRenderLayer, preRenderFrame, postRender,
    postRenderLayer, postRenderFrame) are switched as a unit. At render time, the
    software rendering code invokes the callbacks of the default traversal set.  The
    prepareRender scripting capability allows for the development of multiple
    rendering preparation scripts, including from plugins, to provide extensibility
    rather than being constrained to a single implementation. A special traversal
    set is the nulltraversal set.  It is the initial default traversal set, and
    cannot be deregistered.  It performs no work, and does not save and restore the
    assembly node active representation configuration.  It will provide WYSIWYG
    (What You See Is What You Get) rendering of assembly nodes, without switching to
    a different representation to render. Render traversals are invoked by Maya
    using this command's create mode. This is done by Maya's rendering
    infrastructure, and should not be required unless developing new render views or
    batch render code.  Most uses of this command will simply use the edit mode to
    register render traversals into a render traversal set, or the query mode to
    query the names of the render traversals in a render traversal set. The
    prepareRender command has support for saving and restoring the active
    representation of assembly nodes in the scene.  Use the saveAssemblyConfig flag
    to indicate that the render traversal set requires saving the assembly node
    active representation before rendering begins, and should restore the assembly
    node active representation after rendering ends. It is the responsibility of
    render traversals that modify the scene in ways other than changing the active
    representation on assembly nodes to restore the scene to its previous state,
    most likely using the postRender, postRenderLayer, and postRenderFrame
    traversals. Note that Maya does not call the prepareRender -restore command on
    batch render completion, since batch rendering is done on a copy of the scene
    which is discarded once rendering terminates.  Implementors of render traversals
    may wish to check whether they are running in batch mode, to implement the same
    optimization.            In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.
    
    Flags:
    - defaultTraversalSet : dt       (unicode)       [query,edit]
        Set or query the default traversal set.  The prepareRender command performs

        callback can query using the setParent command.  The traversal set will be the
        default traversal set, unless the -traversalSet flag is used to specify an
        explicit traversal set.
    
    - label : lbl                    (unicode)       [query,edit]
        Set or query the label for a given traversal set.  The label is used for UI
        display purposes, and can be localized.  The traversal set will be the default,

    - postRenderLayer : pol          (script)        [query,edit]
        Set or query the postRenderLayer render traversal for a given traversal set.
        This traversal is run after a render layer is rendered, within a render.  The

    This command manages camera set nodes. Camera sets allow the users to break a
    single camera shot into layers. Instead of drawing all objects with a single
    camera, you can isolate the camera to only focus on certain objects and layer
    another camera into the viewport that draws the other objects. The situation to
    use camera sets primarily occurs when building stereoscopic scenes. For example,
    a set of stereo parameters may make the background objects divergent beyond the
    tolerable range of the human perceptual system. However, you like the settings
    because the main focus is in the foreground and the depth is important to the
    visual look of the scene.  You can use camera sets to break apart the shot into
    a foreground stereo camera and background stereo camera. The foreground stereo
    camera will retain the original parameters; however, it will only focus on the
    foreground elements.  The background stereo camera will have a different set of
    stereo parameters and will only draw the background element. Camera sets can be
    viewed using the stereo viewer and are currently only designed to work with
    stereo camera rigs.

        Sets a mode so that UV transformations in the UV Texture Editor will cause UV
        values to snap to image pixel corners. Which pixels are used depends on whether
        a Texture Image or an Editor Image is being displayed. If both are displayed,
        the Texture Image pixels will be used.
    
    - imageRatio : imr               (bool)          [query,edit]

        the width is greater than the height, then the width is set to be 1 unitin the
        window, and the height is adjusted by width divided by height. This only affects

        how many times the image is tiled based on appropriate parameters (e.g. Repeat
        UV, Mirror, Wrap, etc...) When viewing an Editor Image these values determine
        the visible size of the image. For example, setting the range to ( 0, 0, 2, 1 )
        will cause the Editor Image to be loaded into a 2x1 rectangle, distorting it as
        necessary to fill the available space.

    - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL
        version of the callback is of the form: global proc string[] callbackName(string
        $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that is
        transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array
        describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined
        drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
        CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3
        == CTRL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the
        callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
        argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def
        callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The values of these arguments are
        the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the
        callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the
        string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format
        operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys
        dragControl, x, y, modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other
        values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s
        %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
    - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above
        the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form: global proc
        callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x,
        int $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the
        drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined
        message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the
        callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python,
        it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended
        way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the
        Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the
        same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback
        in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will
        have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.
        The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the
        other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
        '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
    - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the
        control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-
        out indicating it is disabled.
    
    - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Enables the background color of the control.
    
    - enableKeyboardFocus : ekf      (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select
        values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag
        would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that
        get it by default, like Edit and List controls
    
    - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
        Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

    - height : h                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
        The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is
        not overruled by parent layout conditions.
    
    - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
        The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green,
        and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
    
    - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
        Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be
        obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by
        some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
        window is invisible or iconified.
    
    - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,edit]

    - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it
        take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
    
    - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
        Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should
        not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of
        this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
    - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
        Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
    
    - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
        The parent layout for this control.
    
    - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
        Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
    
    - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's
        right mouse button menu.
    
    - statusBarMessage : sbm         (unicode)       [create,edit]

    - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
        Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
    - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.
        Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state
        of its parent layout(s).
    
    - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
        Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
    
    - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
        The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not
        overruled by parent layout conditions.                  Flag can have multiple
        arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    TlightCmd is the base class for other light commands. TnonAmbientLightCmd is a
    class that looks like a command but is not.  It is a base class for the
    extended/nonExtended lights. TnonExtendedLightCmd is a base class and not a real
    command. It is inherited by several lights: TpointLight, TdirectionalLight,
    TspotLight etc. The directionalLight command is used to edit the parameters of
    existing directionalLights, or to create new ones. The default behaviour is to
    create a new directionallight. This is the commmand that instantiates an
    directionalLight or edits the parameters of an existing one.
    TdirectionalLightCmd inherits from TnonExtendedLightCmd which defines softShadow
    flags. See TlightCmd for a global picture of the light commands.
    TdirectionalLightCmd behaves like any other command, it has flags, saves undo
    information etc. the only slightly different behaviour is that it calls up to
    TnonExtendedLightCmd to complete the functionality of the command.
