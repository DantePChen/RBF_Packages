    Helper class that maintains the playback mode information.
    
    It maintains state information for all playback options so that they can be
    modified within a scope and have the original settings restored on completion.
    
    Calling any of the setXXX() methods
    
    The object is set up to use the Python "with" syntax as follows:
    
        with PlaybackManager() as mgr:
            mgr.minTime = new_start_frame
    
    That will ensure the original states are all restored. There's no other
    reliable way to do it in Python. If you need different scoping that can't
    be put into a nice code block like this you can manually call the methods
    to complete the sequence:
    
        mgr = PlaybackManager()
            ...
        mgr.minTime = new_start_frame )
            ...
        mgr.restore()
    
    You may also be interested in this utility method that will playback the
    entire range from the start in 'wait' mode. You want this because if you
    don't play in 'wait' mode then your manager can go out of scope while
    playback is running, messing up your state on exit.
    
        with PlaybackManager() as mgr:
            mgr.play_all()
    
    See also mgr.play_range() and mgr.play_limited_range() for other options.
