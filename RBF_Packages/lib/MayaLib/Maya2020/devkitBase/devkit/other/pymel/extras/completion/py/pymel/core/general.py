        Flags:
        - force : f                      (bool)          [create]
            Forces the connection.  If the destination is already connected, the old
            connection is broken and the new one made.
        
        - lock : l                       (bool)          [create]
            If the argument is true, the destination attribute is locked after making the
            connection. If the argument is false, the connection is unlocked before making
            the connection.

            this flag specified, a connection is made to the next available index. No index
            need be specified.
        
        - referenceDest : rd             (unicode)       [create]
            This flag is used for file io only. The flag indicates that the connection
            replaces a connection made in a referenced file, and the flag argument indicates
            the original destination from the referenced file. This flag is used so that if
            the reference file is modified, maya can still attempt to make the appropriate
            connections in the main scene to the referenced object.                  Flag
            can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

            Returns the type of data currently in the attribute. Attributes of simple types
            such as strings and numerics always contain data, but attributes of complex
            types (arrays, meshes, etc) may contain no data if none has ever been assigned
            to them. When this happens the command will return with no result: not an empty
            string, but no result at all. Attempting to directly compare this non-result to
            another value or use it in an expression will result in an error, but you can
            assign it to a variable in which case the variable will be set to the default
            value for its type (e.g. an empty string for a string variable, zero for an
            integer variable, an empty array for an array variable). So to be safe when
            using this flag, always assign its result to a string variable, never try to use
            it directly.                   Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either
            as a tuple or a list.

        Sets the value of a dependency node attribute.  No value for the the attribute

        Maya Bug Fix:
          - setAttr did not work with type matrix.
        
        Modifications:
          - No need to set type, this will automatically be determined
          - Adds support for passing a list or tuple as the second argument for datatypes such as double3.
          - When setting stringArray datatype, you no longer need to prefix the list with the number of elements - just pass a list or tuple as with other arrays
          - Added 'force' kwarg, which causes the attribute to be added if it does not exist.
                - if no type flag is passed, the attribute type is based on type of value being set (if you want a float, be sure to format it as a float, e.g.  3.0 not 3)
                - currently does not support compound attributes
                - currently supported python-to-maya mappings:

          - Added ability to set enum attributes using the string values; this may be
            done either by setting the 'asString' kwarg to True, or simply supplying
            a string value for an enum attribute.
        
        Flags:
        - alteredValue : av              (bool)          [create]
            The value is only the current value, which may change in the next evalution (if
            the attribute has an incoming connection). This flag is only used during file
            I/O, so that attributes with incoming connections do not have their data
            overwritten during the first evaluation after a file is opened.
        
        - caching : ca                   (bool)          [create]
            Sets the attribute's internal caching on or off. Not all attributes can be
            defined as caching. Only those attributes that are not defined by default to be
            cached can be made caching.  As well, multi attribute elements cannot be made
            caching. Caching also affects child attributes for compound attributes.
        
        - capacityHint : ch              (int)           [create]
            Used to provide a memory allocation hint to attributes where the -size flag
            cannot provide enough information. This flag is optional and is primarily
            intended to be used during file I/O. Only certain attributes make use of this
            flag, and the interpretation of the flag value varies per attribute. This flag
            is currently used by (node.attribute): mesh.face - hints the total number of
            elements in the face edge lists
        
        - channelBox : cb                (bool)          [create]
            Sets the attribute's display in the channelBox on or off. Keyable attributes are
            always display in the channelBox regardless of the channelBox settting.
        
        - clamp : c                      (bool)          [create]
            For numeric attributes, if the value is outside the range of the attribute,
            clamp it to the min or max instead of failing
        
        - keyable : k                    (bool)          [create]
            Sets the attribute's keyable state on or off.
        
        - lock : l                       (bool)          [create]

            Sets an identity key on an animation layer.  An identity key is one that
            nullifies the effect of the anim layer.  This flag has effect only when the
            attribute being keyed is being driven by animation layers.

            Insert keys at the given time(s) and preserve the shape of the animation
            curve(s). Note: the tangent type on inserted keys will be fixed so that the
            curve shape can be preserved.
        
        - insertBlend : ib               (bool)          [create]
            If true, a pairBlend node will be inserted for channels that have nodes other
            than animCurves driving them, so that such channels can have blended animation.
            If false, these channels will not have keys inserted. If the flag is not
            specified, the blend will be inserted based on the global preference for
            blending animation.
        
        - minimizeRotation : mr          (bool)          [create]
            For rotations, ensures that the key that is set is a minimum distance away from

            animation layers.
        
        - outTangentType : ott           (unicode)       [create]
            The out tangent type for keyframes set by this command. Valid values are: auto,
            clamped, fast, flat, linear, plateau, slow, spline, step, and stepnext. Default
            is keyTangent -q -g -outTangentType
        
        - respectKeyable : rk            (bool)          [create]
            When used with the -attribute flag, prevents the keying of the non keyable
            attributes.
        
        - shape : s                      (bool)          [create]
            Consider attributes of shapes below transforms as well, except controlPoints.
            Default: true
        
        - time : t                       (time)          [create]
            Time at which to set a keyframe on time-based animation curves.
        
        - useCurrentLockedWeights : lw   (bool)          [create]
            If we are setting a key over an existing key, use that key tangent's locked
            weight value for the new locked weight value.  Default is false
        
        - value : v                      (float)         [create]
            Value at which to set the keyframe. Using the value flag will not cause the
            keyed attribute to change to the specified value until the scene re-evaluates.
            Therefore, if you want the attribute to update to the new value immediately, use
            the setAttr command in addition to setting the key.                  Flag can
            have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    assembly command can create any node that is derived from the assembly node base
    class.  It also acts as a registry of these types, so that various scripting
    callbacks can be defined and registered with the assembly command.  These
    callbacks are invoked by Maya during operations on assembly nodes, and can be
    used to customize behavior. In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.
    
    Flags:
    - active : a                     (unicode)       [query,edit]
        Set the active representation by name, or query the name of the active
        representation. Edit mode can be applied to more than one assembly. Query mode
        will return a single string when only a single assembly is specified, and will
        return an array of strings when multiple assemblies are specified. Using an
        empty string as name means to inactivate the currently active representation.
    
    - activeLabel : al               (unicode)       [query,edit]
        Set the active representation by label, or query the label of the active
        representation. Edit mode can be applied to more than one assembly. Query mode
        will return a single string when only a single assembly is specified, and will
        return an array of strings when multiple assemblies are specified.
    
    - canCreate : cc                 (unicode)       [query]
        Query the representation types the specific assembly can create.
    
    - createOptionBoxProc : cob      (script)        [query,edit]
        Set or query the option box menu procedure for a specific assembly type. The
        assembly type will be the default type, unless the -type flag is used to specify
        an explicit assembly type.
    
    - createRepresentation : cr      (unicode)       [edit]
        Create and add a specific type of representation for an assembly. If the
        representation type needs additional parameters, they must be specified using
        the inputflag. For example, the Maya scene assembly reference implementation
        Cache and Scene representations need an input file.
    
    - defaultType : dt               (unicode)       [query,edit]
        Set or query the default type of assembly.  When the assembly command is used to
        perform an operation on an assembly type rather than on an assembly object, it
        will be performed on the default type, unless the -type flag is used to specify
        an explicit assembly type.
    
    - deleteRepresentation : dr      (unicode)       [edit]
        Delete a specific representation from an assembly.
    
    - deregister : d                 (unicode)       [edit]
        Deregister a registered assembly type. If the deregistered type is the default
        type, the default type will be set to the empty string.
    
    - input : input                  (unicode)       [edit]
        Specify the additional parameters of representation creation procedure when
        creating a representation. This flag must be used with createRepresentation
        flag.
    
    - isAType : isa                  (unicode)       [query]
        Query whether the given object is of an assembly type.
    
    - isTrackingMemberEdits : ite    (unicode)       [query]
        Query whether the given object is tracking member edits.
    
    - label : lbl                    (unicode)       [query,edit]
        Set or query the label for an assembly type. Assembly type is specified with
        flag type. If no type specified, the default type is used.
    
    - listRepTypes : lrt             (bool)          [query]
        Query the supported representation types for a given assembly type.  The
        assembly type will be the default type, unless the -type flag is used to specify
        an explicit assembly type.
    
    - listRepTypesProc : lrp         (script)        [query,edit]
        Set or query the procedure that provides the representation type list which an
        assembly type supports.  This procedure takes no argument, and returns a string
        array of representation types that represents the full set of representation
        types this assembly type can create.  The assembly type for which this procedure
        applies will be the default type, unless the type flag is used to specify an
        explicit assembly type.
    
    - listRepresentations : lr       (bool)          [query]
        Query the created representations list for a specific assembly.  The -repType
        flag can be used to filter the list and return representations for a single
        representation type.  If the -repType flag is not used, all created
        representations will be returned.
    
    - listTypes : lt                 (bool)          [query]
        Query the supported assembly types.
    
    - name : n                       (unicode)       [create]
        Specify the name of the assembly when creating it.
    
    - newRepLabel : nrl              (unicode)       [edit]
        Specify the representation label to set on representation label edit.
    
    - postCreateUIProc : aoc         (script)        [query,edit]
        Set or query the UI post-creation procedure for a given assembly type. This
        procedure will be invoked by Maya immediately after an assembly of the specified
        type is created from the UI, but not through scripting.  It can be used to
        invoke a dialog, to obtain and set initial parameters on a newly-created
        assembly.  The assembly type will be the default type, unless the -type flag is
        used to specify an explicit assembly type.
    
    - proc : prc                     (script)        [edit]
        Specify the procedure when setting the representation UI post- or pre-creation
        procedure, for a given assembly type.  The assembly type will be the default
        type, unless the -type flag is used to specify an explicit assembly type.
    
    - renameRepresentation : rnr     (unicode)       [edit]
        Renames the representation that is the argument to this flag.  The repName flag
        must be used to provide the new name.
    
    - repLabel : rl                  (unicode)       [query,edit]
        Query or edit the label of the representation that is the argument to this flag,
        for a given assembly.  In both query and edit modes, the -repLabel flag
        specifies the name of the representation.  In edit mode, the -newRepLabel flag
        must be used to specify the new representation label.
    
    - repName : rnm                  (unicode)       [edit]
        Specify the representation name to set on representation creation or rename.
        This flag is optional with the createRepresentation flag: if omitted, the
        assembly will name the representation.  It is mandatory with the
        renameRepresentation flag.
    
    - repNamespace : rns             (unicode)       [query]
        Query the representation namespace of this assembly node. The value returned is
        used by Maya for creating the namespace where nodes created by the activation of
        a representation will be added. If a name clash occurs when the namespace is
        added to its parent namespace, Maya will update repNamespace with the new name.
        Two namespaces are involved when dealing with an assembly node: the namespace of
        the assembly node itself (which this flag does not affect or query), and the
        namespace of its representations. The representation namespace is a child of its
        assembly node's namespace. The assembly node's namespace is set by its
        containing assembly, if it is nested, or by the top-level file. Either the
        assembly node's namespace, or the representation namespace, or both, can be the
        empty string. It should be noted that if the assembly node is nested, the
        assembly node's namespace will be (by virtue of its nesting) the representation
        namespace of its containing assembly.
    
    - repPostCreateUIProc : poc      (unicode)       [query,edit]
        Set or query the UI post-creation procedure for a specific representation type,
        and for a specific assembly type.  This procedure takes two arguments, the first
        the DAG path to the assembly, and the second the name of the representation.  It
        returns no value.  It will be invoked by Maya immediately after a representation
        of the specified type is created from the UI, but not through scripting.  It can
        be used to invoke a dialog, to obtain and set initial parameters on a newly-
        created representation.  The representation type is the argument of this flag.
        The -proc flag must be used to specify the procedure name.  The assembly type
        will be the default type, unless the -type flag is used to specify an explicit
        assembly type.
    
    - repPreCreateUIProc : pec       (unicode)       [query,edit]
        Set or query the UI pre-creation procedure for a specific representation type,
        and for a specific assembly type.  This procedure takes no argument, and returns
        a string that is passed as an argument to the -input flag when Maya invokes the
        assembly command with the -createRepresentation flag. The representation pre-
        creation procedure is invoked by Maya immediately before creating a
        representation of the specified type from the UI, but not through scripting.  It
        can be used to invoke a dialog, to obtain the creation argument for a new
        representation.  The representation type is the argument of this flag.  The
        -proc flag must be used to specify the procedure name.  The assembly type will
        be the default type, unless the -type flag is used to specify an explicit
        assembly type.
    
    - repType : rt                   (unicode)       [query]
        Specify a representation type to use as a filter for the -listRepresentations
        query.  The representation type is the argument to this flag.
    
    - repTypeLabel : rtl             (unicode)       [query]
        Query the label of the specific representation type.
    
    - repTypeLabelProc : rtp         (script)        [query,edit]
        Set or query the procedure that provides the representation type label, for a
        given assembly type.  The procedure takes the representation type as its sole
        argument, and returns a localized representation type label. The assembly type
        for which this procedure applies will be the default type, unless the -type flag
        is used to specify an explicit assembly type.
    
    - type : typ                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Set or query properties for the specified registered assembly type. Flag can
        have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

def move(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The move command is used to change the positions of geometric objects. The
    default behaviour, when no objects or flags are passed, is to do a absolute move
    on each currently selected object in the world space. The value of the
    coordinates are interpreted as being defined in the current linear unit unless
    the unit is explicitly mentioned. When using -objectSpace there are two ways to
    use this command. If numbers are typed without units then the internal values of
    the object are set to these values. If, on the other hand a unit is specified
    then the internal value is set to the equivalent internal value that represents
    that world-space distance. The -localSpace flag moves the object in its parent
    space. In this space the x,y,z values correspond directly to the tx, ty, tz
    channels on the object. The -rotatePivotRelative/-scalePivotRelative flags can
    be used with the -absolute flag to translate an object so that its pivot point
    ends up at the given absolute position. These flags will be ignored if
    components are specified. The -worldSpaceDistance flag is a modifier flag that
    may be used in conjunction with the -objectSpace/-localSpace flags. When this
    flag is specified the command treats the x,y,z values as world space units so
    the object will move the specified world space distance but it will move along
    the axis specified by the -objectSpace/-localSpace flag. The default behaviour,
    without this flag, is to treat the x,y,z values as units in object space or
    local space. In other words, the worldspace distance moved will depend on the
    transformations applied to the object unless this flag is specified.
    
    Modifications:
      - allows any iterable object to be passed as first argument::

def select(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command is used to put objects onto or off of the active list. If none of
    the five flags [-add, -af, -r, -d, -tgl] are specified, the default is to
    replace the objects on the active list with the given list of objects. When
    selecting a set as in select set1, the behaviour is for all the members of the
    set to become selected instead of the set itself. If you want to select a set,
    the -ne/noExpandflag must be used. With the advent of namespaces, selection by
    name may be confusing.  To clarify, without a qualified namespace, name lookup
    is limited to objects in the root namespace :. There are really two parts of a
    name: the namespace and the name itself which is unique within the namespace. If
    you want to select objects in a specific namespace, you need to include the
    namespace separator :. For example, 'select -r foo\*' is trying to look for an
    object with the fooprefix in the root namespace. It is not trying to look for
    all objects in the namespace with the fooprefix. If you want to select all
    objects in a namespace (foo), use 'select foo:\*'. Note: When the application
    starts up, there are several dependency nodes created by the system which must
    exist. These objects are not deletable but are selectable.  All objects (dag and
    dependency nodes) in the scene can be obtained using the lscommand without any
    arguments. When using the -all, adn/allDependencyNodesor
    -ado/allDagObjectsflags, only the deletable objects are selected.  The non
    deletable object can still be selected by explicitly specifying their name as in
    select time1;.
    
    Modifications:
      - passing an empty list no longer causes an error.
          instead, the selection is cleared if the selection mod is replace (the default);
          otherwise, it does nothing

    - clear : cl                     (bool)          [create]
        Clears the active list.  This is more efficient than select -d;.  Also select
        -d;will not remove sets from the active list unless the -neflag is also
        specified.
    
    - containerCentric : cc          (bool)          [create]
        Specifies that the same selection rules as apply to selection in the main
        viewport will also be applied to the select command. In particular, if the
        specified objects are members of a black-boxed container and are not published
        as nodes, Maya will not select them. Instead, their first parent valid for
        selection will be selected.
    
    - deselect : d                   (bool)          [create]

        should also be selected.
    
    - noExpand : ne                  (bool)          [create]
        Indicates that any set which is among the specified items should not be expanded
        to its list of members. This allows sets to be selected as opposed to the
        members of sets which is the default behaviour.
    
    - replace : r                    (bool)          [create]

        this flag has no effect.
    
    - symmetrySide : sys             (int)           [create]
        Indicates that components involved in the current symmetry object should be
        selected, according to the supplied parameter. Valid values for the parameter
        are: -1 : Select components in the unsymmetrical region. 0 : Select components
        on the symmetry seam. 1 : Select components on side 1. 2 : Select components on
        side 2. If symmetric modeling is not enabled then this flag has no effect. Note:
        currently only works for topological symmetry.
    
    - toggle : tgl                   (bool)          [create]
        Indicates that those items on the given list which are on the active list should
        be removed from the active list and those items on the given list which are not
        on the active list should be added to the active list.
    
    - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create]
        Indicates that of the specified items only those that are visible should be

    This command is used to create a set, query some state of a set, or perform
    operations to update the membership of a set. A set is a logical grouping of an
    arbitrary collection of objects, attributes, or components of objects. Sets are
    dependency nodes. Connections from objects to a set define membership in the
    set. Sets are used throughout Maya in a multitude of ways. They are used to
    define an association of material properties to objects, to define an
    association of lights to objects, to define a bookmark or named collection of
    objects, to define a character, and to define the components to be deformed by
    some deformation operation. Sets can be connected to any number of partitions. A
    partition is a node which enforces mutual exclusivity amoung the sets in the
    partition. That is, if an object is in a set which is in a partition, that
    object cannot be a member of any other set that is in the partition. Without any
    flags, the setscommand will create a set with a default name of set#(where # is
    an integer). If no items are specified on the command line, the currently
    selected items are added to the set. The -em/empty flag can be used to create an
    empty set and not have the selected items added to the set. Sets can be created
    to have certain restrictions on membership. There can be renderablesets which
    only allow renderable objects (such as nurbs geometry or polymesh faces) to be
    members of the set. There can also be vertex (or control point), edit point,
    edge, or face sets which only allow those types of components to be members of a
    set. Note that for these sets, if an object with a valid type of component is to
    be added to a set, the components of the object are added to the set instead.
    Sets can have an associated color which is only of use when creating vertex
    sets. The color can be one of the eight user defined colors defined in the color
    preferences. This color can be used, for example to distinguish which vertices
    are being deformed by a particular deformation. Objects, components, or
    attributes can be added to a set using one of three flags. The -add/addElement
    flag will add the objects to a set as long as this won't break any mutual
    exclusivity constraints. If there are any items which can't be added, the
    command will fail. The -in/include flag will only add those items which can be
    added and warn of those which can't. The -fe/forceElement flag will add all the
    items to the set but will also remove any of those items that are in any other
    set which is in the same partition as the set. There are several operations on
    sets that can be performed with the setscommand. Membership can be queried.
    Tests for whether an item is in a set or whether two sets share the same item
    can be performed. Also, the union, intersection and difference of sets can be
    performed which returns a list of members of the sets which are a result of the
    operation.

        Adds the list of items to the given set.  If some of the items cannot be added
        to the set because they are in another set which is in the same partition as the
        set to edit, the command will fail.
    
    - afterFilters : af              (bool)          [edit]
        Default state is false. This flag is valid in edit mode only. This flag is for
        use on sets that are acted on by deformers such as sculpt, lattice, blendShape.
        The default edit mode is to edit the membership of the group acted on by the
        deformer. If you want to edit the group but not change the membership of the
        deformer, set the flag to true.
    
    - clear : cl                     (PyNode)        [edit]
        An operation which removes all items from the given set making the set empty.
    
    - color : co                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Defines the hilite color of the set. Must be a value in range [-1, 7] (one of
        the user defined colors).  -1 marks the color has being undefined and therefore
        not having any affect. Only the vertices of a vertex set will be displayed in
        this color.
    
    - copy : cp                      (PyNode)        [create]
        Copies the members of the given set to a new set. This flag is for use in
        creation mode only.
    
    - edges : eg                     (bool)          [create,query]
        Indicates the new set can contain edges only. This flag is for use in creation
        or query mode only. The default value is false.
    
    - editPoints : ep                (bool)          [create,query]
        Indicates the new set can contain editPoints only. This flag is for use in
        creation or query mode only. The default value is false.
    
    - empty : em                     (bool)          [create]
        Indicates that the set to be created should be empty. That is, it ignores any
        arguments identifying objects to be added to the set. This flag is only valid
        for operations that create a new set.
    
    - facets : fc                    (bool)          [create,query]
        Indicates the new set can contain facets only. This flag is for use in creation
        or query mode only. The default value is false.
    
    - flatten : fl                   (PyNode)        [edit]
        An operation that flattens the structure of the given set. That is, any sets
        contained by the given set will be replaced by its members so that the set no
        longer contains other sets but contains the other sets' members.
    
    - forceElement : fe              (PyNode)        [edit]
        For use in edit mode only. Forces addition of the items to the set. If the items
        are in another set which is in the same partition as the given set, the items
        will be removed from the other set in order to keep the sets in the partition
        mutually exclusive with respect to membership.
    
    - include : include              (PyNode)        [edit]
        Adds the list of items to the given set.  If some of the items cannot be added
        to the set, a warning will be issued. This is a less strict version of the
        -add/addElement operation.
    
    - intersection : int             (PyNode)        [create]
        An operation that returns a list of items which are members of all the sets in
        the list.
    
    - isIntersecting : ii            (PyNode)        [create]
        An operation which tests whether the sets in the list have common members.
    
    - isMember : im                  (PyNode)        [create]
        An operation which tests whether all the given items are members of the given
        set.
    
    - layer : l                      (bool)          [create]
        OBSOLETE. DO NOT USE.
    
    - name : n                       (unicode)       [create]
        Assigns string as the name for a new set. This flag is only valid for operations
        that create a new set.
    
    - noSurfaceShader : nss          (bool)          [create]
        If set is renderable, do not connect it to the default surface shader.  Flag has
        no meaning or effect for non renderable sets. This flag is for use in creation
        mode only. The default value is false.
    
    - noWarnings : nw                (bool)          [create]
        Indicates that warning messages should not be reported such as when trying to
        add an invalid item to a set. (used by UI)
    
    - nodesOnly : no                 (bool)          [query]
        This flag is usable with the -q/query flag but is ignored if used with another
        queryable flags. This flag modifies the results of the set membership query such
        that when there are attributes (e.g. sphere1.tx) or components of nodes included
        in the set, only the nodes will be listed. Each node will only be listed once,
        even if more than one attribute or component of the node exists in the set.
    
    - remove : rm                    (PyNode)        [edit]
        Removes the list of items from the given set.
    
    - renderable : r                 (bool)          [create,query]
        This flag indicates that a special type of set should be created. This type of
        set (shadingEngine as opposed to objectSet) has certain restrictions on its
        membership in that it can only contain renderable elements such as lights and
        geometry. These sets are referred to as shading groups and are automatically
        connected to the renderPartitionnode when created (to ensure mutual exclusivity
        of the set's members with the other sets in the partition). This flag is for use
        in creation or query mode only. The default value is false which means a normal
        set is created.
    
    - size : s                       (bool)          [query]
        Use the size flag to query the length of the set.
    
    - split : sp                     (PyNode)        [create]

    This command operates on a keyset.  A keyset is defined as a group of keys
    within a specified time range on one or more animation curves. The animation
    curves comprising a keyset depend on the value of the -animationflag:
    keysOrObjects: Any active keys, when no target objects or -attribute flags
    appear on the command line, orAll animation curves connected to all keyframable
    attributes of objects specified as the command line's targetList, when there are
    no active keys.keys: Only act on active keys or tangents. If there are no active
    keys or tangents, don't do anything. objects: Only act on specified objects.  If
    there are no objects specified, don't do anything. Note that the -animationflag
    can be used to override the curves uniquely identified by the multi-use
    -attributeflag, which takes an argument of the form attributeName, such as
    translateX. Keys on animation curves are identified by either their time values
    or their indices.  Times and indices can be given individually or as part of a
    list or range (see Examples). This command places keyframes and/or keyframe
    tangents on the active list.
    
    Flags:
    - addTo : add                    (bool)          [create]

    - includeUpperBound : iub        (bool)          [create]
        When the -t/time or -f/float flags represent a range of keys, this flag
        determines whether the keys at the upper bound of the range are included in the
        keyset. Default value: true.  This flag is only valid when the argument to the
        -t/time flag is a time range with a lower and upper bound.  (When used with the
        pasteKeycommand, this flag refers only to the time range of the target curve
        that is replaced, when using options such as replace,fitReplace,or
        scaleReplace.This flag has no effect on the curve pasted from the clipboard.)

def ls(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The lscommand returns the names (and optionally the type names) of objects in
    the scene. The most common use of lsis to filter or match objects based on their
    name (using wildcards) or based on their type. By default lswill match any
    object in the scene but it can also be used to filter or list the selected
    objects when used in conjunction with the -selection flag. If type names are
    requested, using the showType flag, they will be interleaved with object names
    so the result will be pairs of object, typevalues. Internal nodes (for example
    itemFilter nodes) are typically filtered so that only scene objects are
    returned. However, using a wildcard will cause all the nodes matching the wild
    card to show up, including internal nodes.  For example, ls \*will list all
    nodes whether internal or not. Use the syntax ::to denote a recursive namespace
    search when listing nodes. For example, ls ::pSphere1would match objects named
    pSphere1in any namespace, at any depth. ls ns::\*would match any node in
    namespace nsor children namespaces. When Maya is in relativeNames mode, the
    lscommand will return names relativeto the current namespace and ls \*will list
    from the the current namespace. For more details, please refer to the
    -relativeNamesflag of the namespacecommand. The command may also be passed node
    UUIDs instead of names/paths, and can return UUIDs instead of names via the
    -uuid flag.
    
    Modifications:
      - Returns PyNode objects, not "names" - all flags which do nothing but modify
        the string name of returned objects are ignored (ie, 'long'); note that
        the 'allPaths' flag DOES have an effect, as PyNode objects are aware of
        their dag paths (ie, two different instances of the same object will result
        in two unique PyNodes)
      - Added new keyword: 'editable' - this will return the inverse set of the readOnly flag. i.e. non-read-only nodes
      - Added new keyword: 'regex' - pass a valid regular expression string, compiled regex pattern, or list thereof.

        The regular expression will be used to search the full DAG path, starting from the right, in a similar fashion to how globs currently work.
        Technically speaking, your regular expression string is used like this::

    - absoluteName : an              (bool)          [create]
        This flag can be used in conjunction with the showNamespace flag to specify that
        the namespace(s) returned by the command be in absolute namespace format. The
        absolute name of the namespace is a full namespace path, starting from the root
        namespace :and including all parent namespaces.  For example :ns:ballis an
        absolute namespace name while ns:ballis not. The absolute namespace name is
        invariant and is not affected by the current namespace or relative namespace
        modes.

    - dagObjects : dag               (bool)          [create]
        List Dag objects of any type. If object name arguments are passed to the command
        then this flag will list all Dag objects below the specified object(s).
    
    - defaultNodes : dn              (bool)          [create]
        Returns default nodes. A default node is one that Maya creates automatically and
        does not get saved out with the scene, although some of its attribute values
        may.
    
    - dependencyNodes : dep          (bool)          [create]
        List dependency nodes. (including Dag objects)

        List all objects of the specified type, but notobjects that are descendents of
        that type. This flag can appear multiple times on the command line. Note: the
        type passed to this flag is the same type name returned from the showType flag.
        This flag cannot be used in conjunction with the type or excludeType flag.
    
    - excludeType : ext              (unicode)       [create]
        List all objects that are not of the specified type. This flag can appear
        multiple times on the command line. Note: the type passed to this flag is the
        same type name returned from the showType flag. This flag cannot be used in
        conjunction with the type or exactType flag.
    
    - flatten : fl                   (bool)          [create]

    - head : hd                      (int)           [create]
        This flag  specifies the maximum number of elements to be returned from the
        beginning of the list of items. Note: each type flag will return at most this
        many items so if multiple type flags are specified then the number of items
        returned can be greater than this amount.
    
    - hilite : hl                    (bool)          [create]
        List objects that are currently hilited for component selection.

    - long : l                       (bool)          [create]
        Return full path names for Dag objects. By default the shortest unique name is
        returned.
    
    - materials : mat                (bool)          [create]
        List materials or shading groups.
    
    - modified : mod                 (bool)          [create]
        When this flag is set, only nodes modified since the last save will be returned.

    - objectsOnly : o                (bool)          [create]
        When this flag is set only object names will be returned and
        components/attributes will be ignored.
    
    - orderedSelection : os          (bool)          [create]
        List objects and components that are currently selected in their order of
        selection.  This flag depends on the value of the -tso/trackSelectionOrder flag
        of the selectPref command.  If that flag is not enabled than this flag will
        return the same thing as the -sl/selection flag would.

    - recursive : r                  (bool)          [create]
        When set to true, this command will look for name matches in all namespaces.
        When set to false, this command will only look for matches in namespaces that
        are requested (e.g. by specifying a name containing the ':'... ns1:pSphere1).

        List the type of each object after its name.
    
    - tail : tl                      (int)           [create]
        This flag specifies the maximum number of elements to be returned from the end
        of the list of items. Note: each    type flag will return at most this many
        items so if multiple type flags are specified then the number of items returned
        can be greater than this amount
    
    - templated : tm                 (bool)          [create]

        a specific object/data type associated with them and will return untypedwhen
        listed with this flag. This flag cannot be used in conjunction with the
        exactType or excludeType flag.
    
    - undeletable : ud               (bool)          [create]
        Returns nodes that cannot be deleted (which includes locked nodes). These nodes
        also cannot be renamed.
    
    - untemplated : ut               (bool)          [create]
        List only un-templated dag nodes.
    
    - uuid : uid                     (bool)          [create]
        Return node UUIDs instead of names. Note that there are no UUID paths- combining
        this flag with e.g. the -long flag will not result in a path formed of node

    This command returns the value of the named object's attribute. UI units are
    used where applicable. Currently, the types of attributes that can be displayed
    are: numeric attributesstring attributesmatrix attributesnumeric compound
    attributes (whose children are all numeric)vector array attributesdouble array

    attributesOther data types cannot be retrieved. No result is returned if the
    attribute contains no data.
    
    Maya Bug Fix:
      - maya pointlessly returned vector results as a tuple wrapped in a list ( ex.  '[(1,2,3)]' ). This command unpacks the vector for you.
    
    Modifications:
      - casts double3 datatypes to `Vector`
      - casts matrix datatypes to `Matrix`
      - casts vectorArrays from a flat array of floats to an array of Vectors
      - when getting a multi-attr, maya would raise an error, but pymel will return a list of values for the multi-attr
      - added a default argument. if the attribute does not exist and this argument is not None, this default value will be returned
      - added support for getting message attributes
    
    Flags:
    - asString : asString            (bool)          [create]
        This flag is only valid for enum attributes. It allows you to get the attribute
        values as strings instead of integer values. Note that the returned string value
        is dependent on the UI language Maya is running in (about -uiLanguage).
    
    - caching : ca                   (bool)          [create]
        Returns whether the attribute is set to be cached internally
    
    - channelBox : cb                (bool)          [create]
        Returns whether the attribute is set to show in the channelBox. Keyable
        attributes also show in the channel box.
    
    - expandEnvironmentVariables : x (bool)          [create]
        Expand any environment variable and (tilde characters on UNIX) found in string
        attributes which are returned.
    
    - keyable : k                    (bool)          [create]
        Returns the keyable state of the attribute.
    
    - lock : l                       (bool)          [create]
        Returns the lock state of the attribute.
    
    - multiIndices : mi              (bool)          [create]
        If the attribute is a multi, this will return a list containing all of the valid
        indices for the attribute.
    
    - settable : se                  (bool)          [create]
        Returns 1 if this attribute is currently settable by setAttr, 0 otherwise. An
        attribute is settable if it's not locked and either not connected, or has only
        keyframed animation.
    
    - silent : sl                    (bool)          [create]
        When evaluating an attribute that is not a numeric or string value, suppress the
        error message saying that the data cannot be displayed. The attribute will be
        evaluated even though its data cannot be displayed. This flag does not suppress
        all error messages, only those that are benign.
    
    - size : s                       (bool)          [create]
        Returns the size of a multi-attribute array.  Returns 1 if non-multi.
    
    - time : t                       (time)          [create]
        Evaluate the attribute at the given time instead of the current time.
    
    - type : typ                     (bool)          [create]
        Returns the type of data currently in the attribute. Attributes of simple types
        such as strings and numerics always contain data, but attributes of complex
        types (arrays, meshes, etc) may contain no data if none has ever been assigned
        to them. When this happens the command will return with no result: not an empty
        string, but no result at all. Attempting to directly compare this non-result to
        another value or use it in an expression will result in an error, but you can
        assign it to a variable in which case the variable will be set to the default
        value for its type (e.g. an empty string for a string variable, zero for an
        integer variable, an empty array for an array variable). So to be safe when
        using this flag, always assign its result to a string variable, never try to use
        it directly.                   Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either
        as a tuple or a list.

    This command duplicates the given objects. If no objects are given, then the
    selected list is duplicated. The smart transform feature allows duplicate to
    transform newly duplicated objects based on previous transformations between
    duplications. Example: Duplicate an object and move it to a new location.
    Duplicate it again with the smart duplicate flag. It should have moved once
    again the distance you had previously moved it. Note: changing the selected list
    between smart duplications will cause the transform information to be deleted
    The upstream Nodes option forces duplication of all upstream nodes leading upto
    the selected objects.. Upstream nodes are defined as all nodes feeding into
    selected nodes. During traversal of Dependency graph, if another dagObject is
    encountered, then that node and all it's parent transforms are also duplicated.
    The inputConnections option forces the duplication of input connections to the
    nodes that are to be duplicated. This is very useful especially in cases where
    two nodes that are connected to each other are specified as nodes to be
    duplicated. In that situation, the connection between the nodes is also
    duplicated. See also:instance
    
    Modifications:
      - new option: addShape
            If addShape evaluates to True, then all arguments fed in must be shapes, and each will be duplicated and added under
            the existing parent transform, instead of duplicating the parent transform.
            The following arguments are incompatible with addShape, and will raise a ValueError if enabled along with addShape:
                renameChildren (rc), instanceLeaf (ilf), parentOnly (po), smartTransform (st)
      - returns wrapped classes
      - returnRootsOnly is forced on for dag objects. This is because the duplicate command does not use full paths when returning
        the names of duplicated objects and will fail if the name is not unique.

        Input connections to the node to be duplicated, are also duplicated. This would
        result in a fan-out scenario as the nodes at the input side are not duplicated
        (unlike the -un option).
    
    - instanceLeaf : ilf             (bool)          [create]

        what is returned in the output string[], and it does NOT change the behaviour of
        the duplicate command.

    Maya Bug Fix:
      - setAttr did not work with type matrix.
    
    Modifications:
      - No need to set type, this will automatically be determined
      - Adds support for passing a list or tuple as the second argument for datatypes such as double3.
      - When setting stringArray datatype, you no longer need to prefix the list with the number of elements - just pass a list or tuple as with other arrays
      - Added 'force' kwarg, which causes the attribute to be added if it does not exist.
            - if no type flag is passed, the attribute type is based on type of value being set (if you want a float, be sure to format it as a float, e.g.  3.0 not 3)
            - currently does not support compound attributes
            - currently supported python-to-maya mappings:

      - Added ability to set enum attributes using the string values; this may be
        done either by setting the 'asString' kwarg to True, or simply supplying
        a string value for an enum attribute.
    
    Flags:
    - alteredValue : av              (bool)          [create]
        The value is only the current value, which may change in the next evalution (if
        the attribute has an incoming connection). This flag is only used during file
        I/O, so that attributes with incoming connections do not have their data
        overwritten during the first evaluation after a file is opened.
    
    - caching : ca                   (bool)          [create]
        Sets the attribute's internal caching on or off. Not all attributes can be
        defined as caching. Only those attributes that are not defined by default to be
        cached can be made caching.  As well, multi attribute elements cannot be made
        caching. Caching also affects child attributes for compound attributes.
    
    - capacityHint : ch              (int)           [create]
        Used to provide a memory allocation hint to attributes where the -size flag
        cannot provide enough information. This flag is optional and is primarily
        intended to be used during file I/O. Only certain attributes make use of this
        flag, and the interpretation of the flag value varies per attribute. This flag
        is currently used by (node.attribute): mesh.face - hints the total number of
        elements in the face edge lists
    
    - channelBox : cb                (bool)          [create]
        Sets the attribute's display in the channelBox on or off. Keyable attributes are
        always display in the channelBox regardless of the channelBox settting.
    
    - clamp : c                      (bool)          [create]
        For numeric attributes, if the value is outside the range of the attribute,
        clamp it to the min or max instead of failing
    
    - keyable : k                    (bool)          [create]
        Sets the attribute's keyable state on or off.
    
    - lock : l                       (bool)          [create]
        Sets the attribute's lock state on or off.
    
    - size : s                       (int)           [create]
        Defines the size of a multi-attribute array. This is only a hint, used to help
        allocate memory as efficiently as possible.
    
    - type : typ                     (unicode)       [create]
        Identifies the type of data.  If the -type flag is not present, a numeric type
        is assumed.                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as
        a tuple or a list.

    Flags:
    - absolute : a                   (bool)          [create]
        preserve existing world object transformations (overall object transformation is
        preserved by modifying the objects local transformation) If the object to parent
        is a joint, it will alter the translation and joint orientation of the joint to
        preserve the world object transformation if this suffices. Otherwise, a
        transform will be inserted between the joint and the parent for this purpose. In
        this case, the transformation inside the joint is not altered. [default]
    
    - addObject : add                (bool)          [create]
        preserve existing local object transformations but don't reparent, just add the
        object(s) under the parent. Use -world to add the world as a parent of the given
        objects.
    
    - noConnections : nc             (bool)          [create]
        The parent command will normally generate new instanced set connections when
        adding instances. (ie. make a connection to the shading engine for new
        instances) This flag suppresses this behaviour and is primarily used by the file
        format.
    
    - noInvScale : nis               (bool)          [create]
        The parent command will normally connect inverseScale to its parent scale on
        joints. This is used to compensate scale on joint. The connection of
        inverseScale will occur if both child and parent are joints and no connection is
        present on child's inverseScale. In case of a reparenting, the old inverseScale
        will only get broken if the old parent is a joint. Otherwise connection will
        remain intact. This flag suppresses this behaviour.
    
    - relative : r                   (bool)          [create]
        preserve existing local object transformations (relative to the parent node)
    
    - removeObject : rm              (bool)          [create]
        Remove the immediate parent of every object specified. To remove only a single
        instance of a shape from a parent, the path to the shape should be specified.
        Note: if there is a single parent then the object is effectively deleted from
        the scene. Use -world to remove the world as a parent of the given object.
    
    - shape : s                      (bool)          [create]
        The parent command usually only operates on transforms.  Using this flags allows
        a shape that is specified to be directly parented under the given transform.
        This is used to instance a shape node. (ie. parent -add -shapeis equivalent to
        the instancecommand). This flag is primarily used by the file format.
    
    - world : w                      (bool)          [create]
        unparent given object(s) (parent to world)                  Flag can have

    This command is used to add a dynamic attribute to a node or nodes. Either the

    an attributeType is specified, a double attribute will be added.  The dataType
    flag can be specified more than once indicating that any of the supplied types
    will be accepted (logical-or).  To add a non-double attribute the following
    criteria can be used to determine whether the dataType or the attributeType flag
    is appropriate.  Some types, such as double3can use either. In these cases the
    -dtflag should be used when you only wish to access the data as an atomic entity
    (eg. you never want to access the three individual values that make up a
    double3).  In general it is best to use the -atin these cases for maximum
    flexibility. In most cases the -dtversion will not display in the attribute
    editor as it is an atomic type and you are not allowed to change individual

      - when editing hasMinValue, hasMaxValue, hasSoftMinValue, or hasSoftMaxValue the passed boolean value was ignored
        and the command instead behaved as a toggle.  The behavior is now more intuitive::

      - allow passing a list or dict instead of a string for enumName
      - allow user to pass in type and determine whether it is a dataType or
        attributeType. Types that may be both, such as float2, float3, double2,
        double3, long2, long3, short2, and short3 are all treated as
        attributeTypes. In addition, as a convenience, since these attributeTypes
        are actually treated as compound attributes, the child attributes are
        automatically created, with X/Y/Z appended, unless usedAsColor is set, in
        which case R/G/B is added. Alternatively, the suffices can explicitly
        specified with childSuffixes:

            >>> addAttr('persp', ln='autoMesh', type='mesh', k=1)
            >>> addAttr('persp.autoMesh', query=1, attributeType=1)
            u'typed'
            >>> addAttr('persp.autoMesh', query=1, dataType=1)
            u'mesh'

            >>> [x.attrName() for x in PyNode('persp').listAttr() if 'autoFloat3' in x.name()]
            [u'autoFloat3Col', u'autoFloat3ColR', u'autoFloat3ColG', u'autoFloat3ColB']

    Flags:
    - attributeType : at             (unicode)       [create,query]
        Specifies the attribute type, see above table for more details. Note that the
        attribute types float, matrixand stringare also MEL keywords and must be
        enclosed in quotes.
    
    - binaryTag : bt                 (unicode)       [create,query]
        This flag is obsolete and does not do anything any more
    
    - cachedInternally : ci          (bool)          [create,query]
        Whether or not attribute data is cached internally in the node. This flag
        defaults to true for writable attributes and false for non-writable attributes.
        A warning will be issued if users attempt to force a writable attribute to be
        uncached as this will make it impossible to set keyframes.
    
    - category : ct                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        An attribute category is a string associated with the attribute to identify it.
        (e.g. the name of a plugin that created the attribute, version information,
        etc.) Any attribute can be associated with an arbitrary number of categories
        however categories can not be removed once associated.
    
    - dataType : dt                  (unicode)       [create,query]
        Specifies the data type.  See setAttrfor more information on data type names.
    
    - defaultValue : dv              (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Specifies the default value for the attribute (can only be used for numeric
        attributes).
    
    - disconnectBehaviour : dcb      (int)           [create,query]
        defines the Disconnect Behaviour 2 Nothing, 1 Reset, 0 Delete
    
    - enumName : en                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Flag used to specify the ui names corresponding to the enum values. The
        specified string should contain a colon-separated list of the names, with
        optional values. If values are not specified, they will treated as sequential
        integers starting with 0. For example: -enumName A:B:Cwould produce options:
        A,B,C with values of 0,1,2; -enumName zero:one:two:thousand=1000would produce
        four options with values 0,1,2,1000; and -enumName
        solo=1:triplet=3:quintet=5would produce three options with values 1,3,5.  (Note
        that there is a current limitation of the Channel Box that will sometimes
        incorrectly display an enumerated attribute's pull-down menu.  Extra menu items
        can appear that represent the numbers inbetween non-sequential option values.
        To avoid this limitation, specify sequential values for the options of any
        enumerated attributes that will appear in the Channel Box.  For example:
        solo=1:triplet=2:quintet=3.)

        Sets the nice name of the attribute for display in the UI.  Setting the
        attribute's nice name to a non-empty string overrides the default behaviour of
        looking up the nice name from Maya's string catalog.   (Use the MEL commands

        Is the attribute to be used as a color definition? Must have 3 DOUBLE or 3 FLOAT
        children to use this flag.  The attribute type -atshould be double3or float3as
        appropriate.  It can also be used to less effect with data types -dtas double3or
        float3as well but some parts of the code do not support this alternative.  The
        special attribute types/data spectrumand reflectancealso support the color flag
        and on them it is set by default.
    
    - usedAsFilename : uaf           (bool)          [create,query]
        Is the attribute to be treated as a filename definition? This flag is only
        supported on attributes with data type -dtof string.

    - current : c                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        In create mode, specify that the newly created asset should be current. In edit
        mode, set the selected asset as current. In query, return the current asset.
    
    - fileName : fn                  (unicode)       [query]
        Used to query for the assets associated with a given file name.
    
    - findContainer : fc             (unicode)       [query]
        When queried, if all the nodes in nodeList belong to the same container, returns
        container's name. Otherwise returns empty string.
    
    - force : f                      (bool)          [create,edit]
        This flag can be used in conjunction with -addNode and -removeNode flags only.
        If specified with -addNode, nodes will be disconnected from their current
        containers before they are added to new one. If specified with -removeNode,
        nodes will be removed from all containers, instead of remaining in the parent
        container if being removed from a nested container.
    
    - includeHierarchyAbove : iha    (bool)          [create,edit]
        Used to specify that the parent hierarchy of the supplied node list should also
        be included in the container (or deleted from the container). Hierarchy
        inclusion will stop at nodes which are members of other containers.
    
    - includeHierarchyBelow : ihb    (bool)          [create,edit]
        Used to specify that the hierarchy below the supplied node list should also be
        included in the container (or delete from the container). Hierarchy inclusion
        will stop at nodes which are members of other containers.
    
    - includeNetwork : inc           (bool)          [create,edit]
        Used to specify that the node network connected to supplied node list should
        also be included in the container. Network traversal will stop at default nodes
        and nodes which are members of other containers.
    
    - includeNetworkDetails : ind    (unicode)       [create,edit]
        Used to specify specific parts of the network that should be included. Valid
        arguments to this flag are: channels, sdk, constraints, historyand expressions,
        inputs, outputs. The difference between this flag and the includeNetwork flag,
        is that it will include all connected nodes regardless of their type. Note that
        dag containers include their children, so they will always include constraint
        nodes that are parented beneath the selected objects, even when constraints are
        not specified as an input.
    
    - includeShaders : isd           (bool)          [create,edit]
        Used to specify that for any shapes included, their shaders will also be
        included in the container.
    
    - includeShapes : ish            (bool)          [create,edit]
        Used to specify that for any transforms selected, their direct child shapes will
        be included in the container (or deleted from the container). This flag is not
        necessary when includeHierarchyBelow is used since the child shapes and all
        other descendents will automatically be included.
    
    - includeTransform : it          (bool)          [create,edit]
        Used to specify that for any shapes selected, their parent transform will be
        included in the container (or deleted from the container). This flag is not
        necessary when includeHierarchyAbove is used since the parent transform and all
        of its parents will automatically be included.
    
    - isContainer : isc              (bool)          [query]
        Return true if the selected or specified node is a container node. If multiple
        containers are queried, only the state of the first will be returned.
    
    - name : n                       (unicode)       [create]
        Sets the name of the newly-created container.
    
    - nodeList : nl                  (bool)          [query]
        When queried, returns a list of nodes in container. The list will be sorted in
        the order they were added to the container. This will also display any
        reordering done with the reorderContainer command.
    
    - nodeNamePrefix : nnp           (bool)          [create,edit]
        Specifies that the name of published attributes should be of the form node_attr.
        Must be used with the -publishConnections/-pc flag.
    
    - parentContainer : par          (bool)          [query]
        Flag to query the parent container of a specified container.
    
    - preview : p                    (bool)          [create]
        This flag is valid in create mode only. It indicates that you do not want the
        container to be created, instead you want to preview its contents. When this
        flag is used, Maya will select the nodes that would be put in the container if
        you did create the container. For example you can see what would go into the
        container with -includeNetwork, then modify your selection as desired, and do a
        create container with the selected objects only.
    
    - publishAndBind : pb            (unicode, unicode) [edit]
        Publish the given name and bind the attribute to the given name. First string
        specifies the node and attribute name in node.attrformat. Second string
        specifies the name it should be published with.
    
    - publishAsChild : pac           (unicode, unicode) [query,edit]
        Publish contained node to the interface of the container to indicate it can be a
        child of external nodes. The second string is the name of the published node. In
        query mode, returns a string of the published names and the corresponding nodes.
        If -publishName flag is used in query mode, only returns the published names; if
        -bindAttr flag is used in query mode, only returns the name of the published
        nodes.
    
    - publishAsParent : pap          (unicode, unicode) [query,edit]
        Publish contained node to the interface of the container to indicate it can be a
        parent to external nodes. The second string is the name of the published node.
        In query mode, returns a string of array of the published names and the
        corresponding nodes. If -publishName flag is used in query mode, only returns
        the published names; if -bindAttr flag is used in query mode, only returns the
        name of the published nodes.
    
    - publishAsRoot : pro            (unicode, bool) [query,edit]
        Publish or unpublish a node as a root. The significance of root transform node
        is twofold. When container-centric selection is enabled, the root transform will
        be selected if a container node in the hierarchy below it is selected in the
        main scene view. Also, when exporting a container proxy, any published root
        transformation attributes such as translate, rotate or scale will be hooked up
        to attributes on a stand-in node. In query mode, returns the node that has been
        published as root.
    
    - publishAttr : pa               (unicode)       [query]
        In query mode, can only be used with the -publishName(-pn) flag, and takes an
        attribute as an argument; returns the published name of the attribute, if any.
    
    - publishConnections : pc        (bool)          [create,edit]
        Publish all connections from nodes inside the container to nodes outside the
        container.
    
    - publishName : pn               (unicode)       [query,edit]
        Publish a name to the interface of the container, and returns the actual name
        published to the interface.  In query mode, returns the published names for the
        container. If the -bindAttr flag is specified, returns only the names that are
        bound; if the -unbindAttr flag is specified, returns only the names that are not
        bound; if the -publishAsParent/-publishAsChild flags are specified, returns only
        names of published parents/children. if the -publishAttr is specified with an
        attribute argument in the node.attrformat, returns the published name for that
        attribute, if any.
    
    - removeContainer : rc           (bool)          [edit]
        Disconnects all the nodes from container and deletes container node.
    
    - removeNode : rn                (unicode)       [edit]
        Specifies the list of nodes to remove from container. If node is a member of a
        nested container, it will be added to the parent container. To remove from all
        containers completely, use the -force flag.
    
    - type : typ                     (unicode)       [create,query]
        By default, a container node will be created. Alternatively, the type flag can
        be used to indicate that a different type of container should be created. At the
        present time, the only other valid type of container node is dagContainer.
    
    - unbindAndUnpublish : ubp       (unicode)       [edit]
        Unbind the given attribute (in node.attrformat) and unpublish its associated
        name. Unbinding a compound may trigger unbinds of its compound parents/children.
        So the advantage of using this one flag is that it will automatically unpublish
        the names associated with these automatic unbinds.
    
    - unbindAttr : ua                (unicode, unicode) [query,edit]
        Unbind a published attribute from its published name on the interface of the
        container, leaving an unbound published name on the interface of the container;
        returns a list of unbound published names. The first string specifies the node
        and attribute name to be unbound in node.attrformat, and the second string
        specifies the name of the bound published name. In query mode, can only be used
        with the -publishName, -publishAsParent and -publishAsChild flags.
    
    - unbindChild : unc              (unicode)       [edit]
        Unbind the node published as child, but do not remove its published name from
        the interface of the container.
    
    - unbindParent : unp             (unicode)       [edit]
        Unbind the node published as parent, but do not remove its published name from
        the interface of the container.
    
    - unpublishChild : upc           (unicode)       [edit]
        Unpublish node published as child from the interface of the container
    
    - unpublishName : un             (unicode)       [edit]
        Unpublish an unbound name from the interface of the container.
    
    - unpublishParent : upp          (unicode)       [edit]
        Unpublish node published as parent from the interface of the container
    
    - unsortedOrder : uso            (bool)          [query]
        This flag has no effect on the operation of the container command (OBSOLETE).
