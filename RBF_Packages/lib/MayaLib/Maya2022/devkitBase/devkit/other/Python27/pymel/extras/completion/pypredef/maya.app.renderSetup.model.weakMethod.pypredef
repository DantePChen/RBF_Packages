"""
Weak references to bound methods cannot be created directly: if no
strong reference to the bound method is kept, the bound method object is
immediately garbage collected, and the weak reference immediately points to
a dead object and returns None.  See:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/599430/why-doesnt-the-weakref-work-on-this-bound-method

This module supports the intent, namely a bound method that can only be called
while its object is alive, and keeps its object by weak reference.
