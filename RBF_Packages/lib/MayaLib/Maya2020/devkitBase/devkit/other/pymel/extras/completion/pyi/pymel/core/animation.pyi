def cluster(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The cluster command creates a cluster or edits the membership of an existing
    cluster. The command returns the name of the cluster node upon creation of a new
    cluster. After creating a cluster, the cluster's weights can be modified using
    the percent command or the set editor window.
    
    Flags:
    - after : af                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new
        geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - afterReference : ar            (bool)          [create,edit]
        The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way
        that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being
        deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new
        deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using
        -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the
        deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to
        lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
    
    - before : bf                    (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new
        geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - bindState : bs                 (bool)          [create]
        When turned on, this flag adds in a compensation to ensure the clustered objects
        preserve their spatial position when clustered. This is required to prevent the
        geometry from jumping at the time the cluster is created in situations when the
        cluster transforms at cluster time are not identity.
    
    - deformerTools : dt             (bool)          [query]
        Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
    
    - envelope : en                  (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Set the envelope value for the deformer. Default is 1.0
    
    - exclusive : ex                 (unicode)       [create,query]
        Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
    
    - frontOfChain : foc             (bool)          [create,edit]
        This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed
        ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but
        not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the
        upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this
        flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset
        (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - geometry : g                   (unicode)       [query,edit]
        The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this
        deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag
        returns string string string ...
    
    - geometryIndices : gi           (bool)          [query]
        Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each
        geometry.
    
    - ignoreSelected : ignoreSelected (bool)          [create]
        Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list

        Default is false.
    
    - name : n                       (unicode)       [create]
        Used to specify the name of the node being created.
    
    - parallel : par                 (bool)          [create,edit]
        Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the
        history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results
        together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry
        added yet).
    
    - prune : pr                     (bool)          [edit]
        Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current
        configuration from the deformer set.
    
    - relative : rel                 (bool)          [create]
        Enable relative mode for the cluster. In relative mode, Only the transformations
        directly above the cluster are used by the cluster. Default is off.
    
    - remove : rm                    (bool)          [edit]
        Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this
        deformer.
    
    - resetGeometry : rg             (bool)          [edit]
        Reset the geometry matrices for the objects being deformed by the cluster. This
        flag is used to get rid of undesirable effects that happen if you scale an
        object that is deformed by a cluster.
    
    - split : sp                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending
        the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if
        the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - weightedNode : wn              (unicode, unicode) [create,query,edit]
        Transform node in the DAG above the cluster to which all percents are applied.
        The second DAGobject specifies the descendent of the first DAGobject from where
        the transformation matrix is evaluated. Default is the cluster handle.

    This command operates on a keyset.  A keyset is defined as a group of keys
    within a specified time range on one or more animation curves. The animation
    curves comprising a keyset depend on the value of the -animationflag:
    keysOrObjects: Any active keys, when no target objects or -attribute flags
    appear on the command line, orAll animation curves connected to all keyframable
    attributes of objects specified as the command line's targetList, when there are

    keys or tangents, don't do anything. objects: Only act on specified objects.  If
    there are no objects specified, don't do anything. Note that the -animationflag
    can be used to override the curves uniquely identified by the multi-use
    -attributeflag, which takes an argument of the form attributeName, such as
    translateX. Keys on animation curves are identified by either their time values
    or their indices.  Times and indices can be given individually or as part of a
    list or range (see Examples). This command edits or queries tangent properties
    of keyframes in a keyset.  It is also used to edit or query the default tangent
    type of newly created keyframes (see the setKeyframe command for more
    information on how to override this default). Tangents help manage the shape of
    the animation curve and affect the interpolation between keys.  The tangent
    angle specifies the direction the curve will take as it leaves (or enters) a
    key. The tangent weight specifies how much influence the tangent angle has on
    the curve before the curve starts towards the next key. Maya internally
    represents tangents as x and y values.  Refer to the API documentation for
    MFnAnimCurve for a description of the relationship between tangent angle and

    - controlPoints : cp             (bool)          [create]
        This flag explicitly specifies whether or not to include the control points of a
        shape (see -sflag) in the list of attributes. Default: false.  (Not valid for
        pasteKeycmd.)
    
    - float : f                      (floatrange)    [create]
        value uniquely representing a non-time-based key (or key range) on a time-based

        Required for all operations on the global tangent type. The global tangent type
        is used by the setKeyframe command when tangent types have not been specifically
        applied, except in combination with flags such as 'i/insert' which preserve the
        shape of the curve.  It is also used when keys are set from the menu. The only
        flags that can appear on a keyTangent command with the 'g/global' flag are
        'itt/inTangentType', 'ott/outTangentType' and 'wt/weightedTangents'.

    - includeUpperBound : iub        (bool)          [create]
        When the -t/time or -f/float flags represent a range of keys, this flag
        determines whether the keys at the upper bound of the range are included in the
        keyset. Default value: true.  This flag is only valid when the argument to the
        -t/time flag is a time range with a lower and upper bound.  (When used with the
        pasteKeycommand, this flag refers only to the time range of the target curve
        that is replaced, when using options such as replace,fitReplace,or
        scaleReplace.This flag has no effect on the curve pasted from the clipboard.)

    - stepAttributes : sa            (bool)          [create,edit]
        The setKeyframe command will automatically set tangents for boolean and
        enumerated attributes to step.  This flag mirrors this behavior for the
        keyTangent command.  When set to false, tangents for these attributes will not
        be edited.  When set to true (the default) tangents for these attributes will be
        edited.
    
    - time : t                       (timerange)     [create]
        time uniquely representing a key (or key range) on a time-based animCurve. See

    - weightedTangents : wt          (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Specify whether or not the tangents on the animCurve are weighted Note:
        switching a curve from weightedTangents true to false and back to true again
        will not preserve fixed tangents properly. Use undo instead.
        Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

def bufferCurve(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command operates on a keyset.  A keyset is defined as a group of keys
    within a specified time range on one or more animation curves. The animation
    curves comprising a keyset depend on the value of the -animationflag:
    keysOrObjects: Any active keys, when no target objects or -attribute flags
    appear on the command line, orAll animation curves connected to all keyframable
    attributes of objects specified as the command line's targetList, when there are
    no active keys.keys: Only act on active keys or tangents. If there are no active
    keys or tangents, don't do anything. objects: Only act on specified objects.  If
    there are no objects specified, don't do anything. Note that the -animationflag
    can be used to override the curves uniquely identified by the multi-use
    -attributeflag, which takes an argument of the form attributeName, such as
    translateX. Keys on animation curves are identified by either their time values
    or their indices.  Times and indices can be given individually or as part of a
    list or range (see Examples). This command helps manage buffer curve for
    animated objects

        chain to the start joint of the handle.
    
    - connectEffector : ce           (bool)          [create,edit]
        This option is set to true as default, meaning that end-effector translate is

        specified with a joint or an end-effector.  If a joint is specified, an end-
        effector will be created at the same position as the joint and this new end-
        effector will be used as the end-effector.
    
    - exists : ex                    (unicode)       [edit]

    - positionWeight : pw            (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Specifies the position/orientation weight of a handle. This is used to compute
        the distancebetween the goal position and the end-effector position.  A
        positionWeight of 1.0 computes the distance as the distance between positions
        only and ignores the orientations.  A positionWeight of 0.0 computes the
        distance as the distance between the orientations only and ignores the
        positions.  A positionWeight of 0.5 attempts to weight the distances equally but
        cannot actually compute this due to unit differences. Because there is no way to
        add linear units and angular units.
    
    - priority : p                   (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Sets the priority of the handle.  Logically, all handles with a lower number
        priority are solved before any handles with a higher numbered priority.  (All
        handles of priority 1 are solved before any handles of priority 2 and so on.)
        Handle priorities must be ] 0.
    
    - rootOnCurve : roc              (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Specifies if the root is locked onto the curve of the ikSplineHandle.
    
    - rootTwistMode : rtm            (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Specifies whether the start joint is allowed to twist or not. If not, then the
        required twist is distributed over the remaining joints. This applies to all the
        twist types.
    
    - setupForRPsolver : srp         (bool)          [edit]
        If the flag is set and ikSolver is ikRPsolver, call RPRotateSetup for the new
        ikHandle. It is for ikRPsolver only.
    
    - simplifyCurve : scv            (bool)          [create]
        Specifies if the ikSplineHandle curve should be simplified.
    
    - snapCurve : snc                (bool)          [create]
        Specifies if the curve should automatically snap to the first joint affected by
        the ikSplineHandle.
    
    - snapHandleFlagToggle : shf     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Specifies that the handle position should be snapped to the end-effector
        position if the end-effector is moved by the user.  Setting this flag on allows
        you to use forward kinematics to pose or adjust your skeleton and then to
        animate it with inverse kinematics.
    
    - snapHandleToEffector : see     (bool)          [edit]
        All handles are immediately moved so that the handle position and orientation
        matches the end-effector position and orientation.
    
    - solver : sol                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Specifies the solver.  The complete list of available solvers may not be known
        until run-time because some of the solvers may be implemented as plug-ins.
        Currently the only valid solver are ikRPsolver, ikSCsolver and ikSplineSolver.
    
    - startJoint : sj                (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Specifies the start joint of the handle's joint chain.
    
    - sticky : s                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Specifies that this handle is sticky. Valid values are off, sticky, superSticky.
        Sticky handles are solved when the skeleton is being manipulated interactively.
        If a character has sticky feet, the solver will attempt to keep them in the same
        position as the user moves the character's root.  If they were not sticky, they
        would move along with the root.
    
    - twistType : tws                (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Specifies the type of interpolation to be used by the ikSplineHandle.  The
        interpolation options are linear, easeIn, easeOut, and easeInOut.
    
    - weight : w                     (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Specifies the handles weight in error calculations.  The weight only applies
        when handle goals are in conflict and cannot be solved simultaneously.  When
        this happens, a solution is computed that weights the distancefrom each goal to
        the solution by the handle's weight and attempts to minimize this value.  The
        weight must be ]= 0.                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed
        either as a tuple or a list.

        lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
    
    - automatic : at                 (bool)          [create,edit]
        The -automatic flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a way that choses
        between -frontOfChain and -before automatically. If the geometry being deformed
        is only affected by invertible deformers, the -frontOfChain mode is used,
        otherwise the -before mode is used.
    
    - before : bf                    (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new
        geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - copyDelta : cd                 (int, int, int) [edit]
        Set the base, source, and destination delta index values.

    - envelope : en                  (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Set the envelope value for the deformer, controlling how much of the total
        deformation gets applied. Default is 1.0.

    - frontOfChain : foc             (bool)          [create,edit]
        This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed
        ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but
        not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the
        upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this
        flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset
        (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).

    - inBetween : ib                 (bool)          [create,edit]
        Indicate that the specified target should serve as an inbetween. An inbetween
        target is one that serves as an intermediate target between the base shape and
        another target.
    
    - inBetweenIndex : ibi           (int)           [edit]
        Only used with the -rtd/-resetTargetDelta flag to remove delta values for points
        in the inbetween target geometry defined by this index.
    
    - inBetweenType : ibt            (unicode)       [create,edit]
        Specify if the in-between target to be created is relative to the hero target or
        if it is absolute. If it is relative to hero targets, the in-between target will
        get any changes made to the hero target. Valid values are relativeand absolute.

        blendShape will be performed with respect to the world by default. Valid values
        are worldand local. The local flag will cause the blend shape to be performed
        with respect to the shape's local origin.
    
    - parallel : par                 (bool)          [create,edit]
        Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the
        history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results
        together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry

        Set transform for target, then the deltas will become relative to a post
        transform. Typically the best workflow for this option is to choose a joint that
        is related to the fix you have introduced. This flag should be used only if the
        Deformation orderof blendShape node is Before.
    
    - weight : w                     (int, float)    [create,query,edit]

    This command operates on a keyset.  A keyset is defined as a group of keys
    within a specified time range on one or more animation curves. The animation

    keysOrObjects: Any active keys, when no target objects or -attribute flags
    appear on the command line, orAll animation curves connected to all keyframable

    there are no objects specified, don't do anything. Note that the -animationflag
    can be used to override the curves uniquely identified by the multi-use
    -attributeflag, which takes an argument of the form attributeName, such as
    translateX. Keys on animation curves are identified by either their time values

        version of the callback is of the form: global proc string[] callbackName(string
        $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that is
        transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array
        describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined
        drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
        CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3
        == CTRL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the
        callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
        argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def
        callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The values of these arguments are
        the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the
        callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the
        string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format
        operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys
        dragControl, x, y, modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other
        values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s

    - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above

        callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x,
        int $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the
        drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined
        message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the
        callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python,
        it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended
        way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the
        Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the

        in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will
        have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.
        The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl,

    - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
        Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should
        not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of

    - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.
        Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state
        of its parent layout(s).
    
    - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
        Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

    the form attributeName, such as translateX. Keys on animation curves are
    identified by either their time values or their indices. Times and indices
    should be specified as a range, as shown below. -time 10:20means all keys in the
    range from 10 to 20, inclusive, in the current time unit.-index 1:5means the
    2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th keys of each animation curve.
    
    Flags:
    - animation : an                 (unicode)       [create]
        Where this command should get the animation to act on. Valid values are
        objects,keys,and keysOrObjectsDefault: keysOrObjects.See command description for
        details.

        List of attributes to select
    
    - bakeOnOverrideLayer : bol      (bool)          [create]

    - controlPoints : cp             (bool)          [create]
        This flag explicitly specifies whether or not to include the control points of a
        shape (see -sflag) in the list of attributes. Default: false.  (Not valid for
        pasteKeycmd.)
    
    - destinationLayer : dl          (unicode)       [create]
        This flag can be used to specify an existing layer where the baked results
        should be stored. Use this flag with caution. If the destination layer already
        has animation on it that contributes to the final result, it will be replaced by
        the output of the bake. As a result, it is possible that the combined animation
        visible in the scene is different before / after the baking process.
    
    - disableImplicitControl : dic   (bool)          [create]
        Whether to disable implicit control after the anim curves are obtained as the
        result of this command. An implicit control to an attribute is some function
        that affects the attribute without using an explicit dependency graph
        connection. The control of IK, via ik handles, is an example.
    
    - float : f                      (floatrange)    [create]
        value uniquely representing a non-time-based key (or key range) on a time-based
        animCurve. Valid floatRange include single values (-f 10) or a string with a
        lower and upper bound, separated by a colon (-f 10:20

        When the -t/time or -f/float flags represent a range of keys, this flag
        determines whether the keys at the upper bound of the range are included in the
        keyset. Default value: true. This flag is only valid when the argument to the
        -t/time flag is a time range with a lower and upper bound. Note: when used with
        the pasteKeycommand, this flag refers only to the time range of the target curve
        that is replaced, when using options such as replace,fitReplace,or
        scaleReplace.This flag has no effect on the curve pasted from the clipboard.
    
    - index : index                  (int)           [create]
        index of a key on an animCurve
    
    - minimizeRotation : mr          (bool)          [create]
        Specify whether to minimize the local Euler component from key to key during
        baking of rotation channels.
    
    - oversamplingRate : osr         (int)           [create]
        Amount of samples per sampleBy period. Default is 1.
    
    - preserveOutsideKeys : pok      (bool)          [create]
        Whether to preserve keys that are outside the bake range when there are directly
        connected animation curves or a pairBlend node which has an animation curve as
        its direct input. The default (false) is to remove frames outside the bake
        range. If the channel that you are baking is not controlled by a single
        animation curve, then a new animation curve will be created with keys only in
        the bake range. In the case of pairBlend-driven channels, setting pok to true
        will retain both the pairBlend and its input animCurve. The blended values will
        be baked onto the animCurve and the weight of the pairBlend weight will be keyed
        to the animCurve during the baked range.
    
    - removeBakedAnimFromLayer : rba (bool)          [create]
        If true, all baked animation will be removed from the layer. Otherwise all layer
        associated with the baked animation will be muted.
    
    - removeBakedAttributeFromLayer : ral (bool)          [create]
        If true, all baked attribute will be removed from the layer. Otherwise all layer
        associated with the baked attribute will be muted.
    
    - resolveWithoutLayer : rwl      (unicode)       [create]
        This flag can be used to specify a list of layers to be merged together during
        the bake process. This is a multi-use flag. Its name refers to the fact that
        when solving for the value to key, it determines the proper value to key on the
        destination layer to achieve the same result as the merged layers.
    
    - sampleBy : sb                  (time)          [create]
        Amount to sample by. Default is 1.0 in current timeUnit.
    
    - shape : s                      (bool)          [create]
        Consider attributes of shapes below transforms as well, except controlPoints.
        Default: true.  (Not valid for pasteKeycmd.)
    
    - simulation : sm                (bool)          [create]
        Using this flag instructs the command to preform a simulation instead of just
        evaluating each attribute separately over the range of time. The simulation flag
        is required to bake animation that that depends on the whole scene being
        evaluated at each time step such as dynamics. The default is false.
    
    - smart : sr                     (bool, float)   [create]
        Specify whether to enable smart bake and the optional smart bake tolerance.
    
    - sparseAnimCurveBake : sac      (bool)          [create]
        When this is true and anim curves are being baked, do not insert any keys into
        areas of the curve where animation is defined. And, use as few keys as possible
        to bake the pre and post infinity behavior. When this is false, one key will be
        inserted at each time step. The default is false.
    
    - time : t                       (timerange)     [create]
        time uniquely representing a key (or key range) on a time-based animCurve. See
        the code examples below on how to format for a single frame or frame ranges.
        Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    Flags:
    - after : af                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new
        geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - afterReference : ar            (bool)          [create,edit]
        The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way
        that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being
        deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new
        deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using
        -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the
        deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to
        lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
    
    - before : bf                    (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new
        geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).

    - envelope : en                  (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Envelope of the tension node. The envelope determines the percent of
        deformation. Value is clamped to [0, 1] range. Default is 1.
    
    - exclusive : ex                 (unicode)       [create,query]
        Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
    
    - frontOfChain : foc             (bool)          [create,edit]
        This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed
        ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but
        not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the
        upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this
        flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset
        (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - geometry : g                   (unicode)       [query,edit]
        The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this
        deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag
        returns string string string ...
    
    - geometryIndices : gi           (bool)          [query]
        Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each
        geometry.

        Constrains the movement of the vertex to not move inward from the input
        deforming shape to preserve the contour. Value is in the [0,1] range. Default is
        0.0.
    
    - name : n                       (unicode)       [create]
        Used to specify the name of the node being created.
    
    - outwardConstraint : owc        (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Constrains the movement of the vertex to not move outward from the input
        deforming shape to preserve the contour. Value is in the [0,1] range.
    
    - parallel : par                 (bool)          [create,edit]
        Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the
        history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results
        together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry
        added yet).
    
    - pinBorderVertices : pbv        (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        If enabled, vertices on mesh borders will be pinned to their current position
        during smoothing. Default is true.
    
    - prune : pr                     (bool)          [edit]
        Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current
        configuration from the deformer set.
    
    - remove : rm                    (bool)          [edit]
        Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this
        deformer.
    
    - smoothingIterations : si       (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Number of smoothing iterations performed by the tension node. Default is 10.

        Step amount used per smoothing iteration. Value is clamped to [0, 1] range. A
        higher value may lead to instabilities but converges faster compared to a lower
        value. Default is 0.5.
    
    - split : sp                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending
        the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if
        the deformer has no geometry added yet).                  Flag can have multiple
        arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

        character's animtion without inserting additional nodes in its hierarchy.
    
    - scheduler : sc                 (bool)          [query]
        Returns the scheduler associated with this character, if there is one. A
        scheduler will only exist if you have created clips on your character.
    
    - split : sp                     (PyNode)        [create]
        Produces a new set with the list of items and removes each item in the list of
        items from the given set.
    
    - subtract : sub                 (PyNode)        [query]
        An operation between two characters which returns the members of the first
        character that are not in the second character. In general, characters should be
        mutually exclusive.
    
    - text : t                       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Defines an annotation string to be stored with the character.
    
    - union : un                     (PyNode)        [query]
        An operation that returns a list of all the members of all characters listed.
    
    - userAlias : ua                 (PyNode)        [query]
        Returns the user defined alias for the given attribute on the character or and
        empty string if there is not one.  Characters automatically alias the attributes
        where character animation data is stored.  A user alias will exist when the
        automatic aliases are overridden using the aliasAttr command.

def skinCluster(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The skinCluster command is used for smooth skinning in maya. It binds the
    selected geometry to the selected joints or skeleton by means of a skinCluster
    node.  Each point of the bound geometry can be affected by any number of joints.
    The extent to which each joint affects the motion of each point is regulated by
    a corresponding weight factor.  Weight factors can be modified using the
    skinPercent command.  The command returns the name of the new skinCluster.The
    skinCluster binds only a single geometry at a time. Thus, to bind multiple
    geometries, multiple skinCluster commands must be issued.Upon creation of a new
    skinCluster, the command can be used to add and remove transforms (not
    necessarily joints) that influence the motion of the bound skin points.  The
    skinCluster command can also be used to adjust parameters such as the dropoff,
    nurbs samples, polygon smoothness on a particular influence object. Note: Any
    custom weights on a skin point that the influence object affects will be lost
    after adjusting these parameters.
    
    Flags:
    - addInfluence : ai              (unicode)       [edit]
        The specified transform or joint will be added to the list of transforms that
        influence the bound geometry. The maximum number of influences will be observed
        and only the weights of the cv's that the specified transform effects will
        change. This flag is multi-use.
    
    - addToSelection : ats           (bool)          [edit]
        When used in conjunction with the selectInfluenceVerts flag, causes the vertices
        afftected by the influence to be added to the current selection, without first
        de-selecting other vertices.
    
    - after : af                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new
        geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - afterReference : ar            (bool)          [create,edit]
        The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way
        that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being
        deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new
        deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using
        -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the
        deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to
        lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
    
    - baseShape : bsh                (unicode)       [edit]
        This flag can be used in conjunction with the -addInfluence flag to specify the
        shape that will be used as the base shape when an influence object with geometry
        is added to the skinCluster.  If the flag is not used then the command will make
        a copy of the influence object's shape and use that as a base shape.
    
    - before : bf                    (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new
        geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - bindMethod : bm                (int)           [create,query]
        This flag sets the binding method. 0 - Closest distance between a joint and a
        point of the geometry. 1 - Closest distance between a joint, considering the
        skeleton hierarchy, and a point of the geometry. 2 - Surface heat map diffusion.
        3 - Geodesic voxel binding.  geomBind command must be called after creating a
        skinCluster with this method.
    
    - deformerTools : dt             (bool)          [query]
        Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
    
    - dropoffRate : dr               (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Sets the rate at which the influence of a transform drops as the distance from
        that transform increases. The valid range is between 0.1 and 10.0.  In Create
        mode it sets the dropoff rate for all the bound joints.  In Edit mode the flag
        is used together with the inf/influence flag to set the dropoff rate of a
        particular influence.  Note: When the flag is used in Edit mode, any custom
        weights on the skin points the given transform influences will be lost.
    
    - exclusive : ex                 (unicode)       [create,query]
        Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
    
    - forceNormalizeWeights : fnw    (bool)          [edit]
        If the normalization mode is none or post, it is possible (indeed likely) for
        the weights in the skin cluster to no longer add up to 1.  This flag forces all
        weights to add back to 1 again.
    
    - frontOfChain : foc             (bool)          [create,edit]
        This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed
        ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but
        not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the
        upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this
        flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset
        (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - geometry : g                   (unicode)       [query,edit]
        The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this
        deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag
        returns string string string ...
    
    - geometryIndices : gi           (bool)          [query]
        Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each
        geometry.
    
    - heatmapFalloff : hmf           (float)         [create]
        This flag sets the heatmap binding falloff. If set to 0.0 (default) the
        deformation will be smoother due to many small weights spread over the mesh
        surface per influence. However, if set to 1.0, corresponding to maximum falloff,
        the number of influences per point will be reduced and points will tend to be
        greatly influenced by their closest joint decreasing the overall spread of small
        weights. This flag only works when using heatmap binding.
    
    - ignoreBindPose : ibp           (bool)          [create,edit]
        This flag is deprecated and no longer used.  It will be ignored if used.
    
    - ignoreHierarchy : ih           (bool)          [create,query]
        Deprecated. Use bindMethod flag instead. Disregard the place of the joints in
        the skeleton hierarchy when computing the closest joints that influence a point
        of the geometry.
    
    - ignoreSelected : ignoreSelected (bool)          [create]
        Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
    
    - includeHiddenSelections : ihs  (bool)          [create]
        Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list.
        Default is false.
    
    - influence : inf                (unicode)       [query,edit]
        This flag specifies the influence object that will be used for the current edit
        operation. In query mode, returns a string array of the influence objects
        (joints and transform).       In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
    
    - lockWeights : lw               (bool)          [query,edit]
        Lock the weights of the specified influence object to their current value or to
        the value specified by the -weight flag.
    
    - maximumInfluences : mi         (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Sets the maximum number of transforms that can influence a point (have non-zero
        weight for the point) when the skinCluster is first created or a new influence
        is added.  Note: When this flag is used in Edit mode any custom weights will be
        lost and new weights will be reassigned to the whole skin.
    
    - moveJointsMode : mjm           (bool)          [edit]
        If set to true, puts the skin into a mode where joints can be moved without
        modifying the skinning. If set to false, takes the skin out of move joints mode.
    
    - name : n                       (unicode)       [create]
        Used to specify the name of the node being created.
    
    - normalizeWeights : nw          (int)           [create,query,edit]
        This flag sets the normalization mode. 0 - none, 1 - interactive, 2 - post
        (default) Interactive normalization makes sure the weights on the influences add
        up to 1.0, always. Everytime a weight is changed, the weights are automatically
        normalized.  This may make it difficult to perform weighting operations, as the
        normalization may interfere with the weights the user has set.  Post
        normalization leaves the weights the user has set as is, and only normalizes the
        weights at the moment it is needed (by dividing by the sum of the weights).
        This makes it easier for users to weight their skins.
    
    - nurbsSamples : ns              (int)           [create,edit]
        Sets the number of sample points that will be used along an influence curve or
        in each direction on an influence NURBS surface to influence the bound skin. The
        more the sample points the more closely the skin follows the influence NURBS
        curve/surface.
    
    - obeyMaxInfluences : omi        (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        When true, the skinCluster will continue to enforce the maximum influences each
        time the user modifies the weight, so that any given point is only weighted by
        the number of influences in the skinCluster's maximumInfluences attribute.
    
    - parallel : par                 (bool)          [create,edit]
        Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the
        history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results
        together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry
        added yet).
    
    - polySmoothness : ps            (float)         [create,edit]
        This flag controls how accurately the skin control points follow a given polygon
        influence object. The higher the value of polySmoothnmess the more rounded the
        deformation resulting from a polygonal influence object will be.
    
    - prune : pr                     (bool)          [edit]
        Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current
        configuration from the deformer set.
    
    - recacheBindMatrices : rbm      (bool)          [edit]
        Forces the skinCluster node to recache its bind matrices.
    
    - remove : rm                    (bool)          [edit]
        Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this
        deformer.
    
    - removeFromSelection : rfs      (bool)          [edit]
        When used in conjunction with the selectInfluenceVerts flag, causes the vertices
        afftected by the influence to be removed from the current selection.
    
    - removeInfluence : ri           (unicode)       [edit]
        Remove the specified transform or joint from the list of transforms that
        influence the bound geometry The weights for the affected points are
        renormalized. This flag is multi-use.
    
    - removeUnusedInfluence : rui    (bool)          [create]
        If this flag is set to true then transform or joint whose weights are all zero
        (they have no effect) will not be bound to the geometry.  Having this option set
        will help speed-up the playback of animation.
    
    - selectInfluenceVerts : siv     (unicode)       [edit]
        Given the name of a transform, this will select the verts or control points
        being influenced by this transform, so users may visualize which vertices are
        being influenced by the transform.
    
    - skinMethod : sm                (int)           [create,query,edit]
        This flag set the skinning method. 0 - classical linear skinning (default). 1 -
        dual quaternion (volume preserving), 2 - a weighted blend between the two.
    
    - smoothWeights : sw             (float)         [edit]
        This flag is used to detect sudden jumps in skin weight values, which often
        indicates bad weighting, and then smooth out those jaggies in skin weights. The
        argument is the error tolerance ranging from 0 to 1.  A value of 1 means that
        the algorithm will smooth a vertex only if there is a 100% change in weight
        values from its neighbors.  The recommended default to use is 0.5 (50% change in
        weight value from the neighbors).
    
    - smoothWeightsMaxIterations : swi (int)           [edit]
        This flag is valid only with the smooth weights flag.  It is possible that not
        all the vertices detected as needing smoothing can be smoothed in 1 iteration
        (because all of their neighbors also have bad weighting and need to be
        smoothed). With more iterations, more vertices can be smoothed.  This flag
        controls the maximum number of iterations the algorithm will attempt to smooth
        weights. The default is 2 for this flag.
    
    - split : sp                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending
        the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if
        the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - toSelectedBones : tsb          (bool)          [create]
        geometry will be bound to the selected bones only.
    
    - toSkeletonAndTransforms : tst  (bool)          [create]
        geometry will be bound to the skeleton and any transforms in the hierarchy. If
        any of the transforms are also bindable objects, assume that only the last
        object passed to the command is the bindable object. The rest are treated as
        influences.
    
    - unbind : ub                    (bool)          [edit]
        Unbinds the geometry from the skinCluster and deletes the skinCluster node
    
    - unbindKeepHistory : ubk        (bool)          [edit]
        Unbinds the geometry from the skinCluster, but keeps the skinCluster node so
        that its weights can be used when the skin is rebound. To rebind, use the
        skinCluster command.
    
    - useGeometry : ug               (bool)          [edit]
        When adding an influence to a skinCluster, use the geometry parented under the
        influence transform to determine the weight dropoff of that influence.
    
    - volumeBind : vb                (float)         [create]
        Creates a volume bind node and attaches it to the new skin cluster node. This
        node holds hull geometry parameters for a volume based weighting system. This
        system is used in interactive skinning. The value passed will determine the
        minimum weight value when initializing the volume. The volume in be increase to
        enclose all the vertices that are above this value.
    
    - volumeType : vt                (int)           [create]
        Defines the initial shape of the binding volume (see volumeBind). 0 - Default
        (currently set to a capsule) 1 - Capsule, 2 - Cylinder.
    
    - weight : wt                    (float)         [edit]
        This flag is only valid in conjunction with the -addInfluence flag. It sets the
        weight for the influence object that is being added.
    
    - weightDistribution : wd        (int)           [create,query,edit]
        This flag sets the weight distribution mode. 0 - distance (default), 1 -
        neighbors When normalizeWeights is in effect, and a weight has been reduced or
        removed altogether, the sum is usually brought back up to 1.0 by increasing the
        contributions of the other non-zero weights. However, if there are no other non-
        zero weights, the algorithm has to create some weights from thin air and
        distribute the residual weight between them. This attribute controls how that is
        done. Distance- the algorithm calculates weights from the world-space distances
        from the component to the transforms. Neighbors- the algorithm calculates
        weights from the weights on the neighboring components.
    
    - weightedInfluence : wi         (bool)          [query]
        This flag returns a string array of the influence objects (joints and transform)
        that have non-zero weighting.                  Flag can have multiple arguments,
        passed either as a tuple or a list.

    """
    This command operates on a keyset.  A keyset is defined as a group of keys
    within a specified time range on one or more animation curves. The animation
    curves comprising a keyset depend on the value of the -animationflag:
    keysOrObjects: Any active keys, when no target objects or -attribute flags
    appear on the command line, orAll animation curves connected to all keyframable
    attributes of objects specified as the command line's targetList, when there are
    no active keys.keys: Only act on active keys or tangents. If there are no active
    keys or tangents, don't do anything. objects: Only act on specified objects.  If
    there are no objects specified, don't do anything. Note that the -animationflag
    can be used to override the curves uniquely identified by the multi-use
    -attributeflag, which takes an argument of the form attributeName, such as
    translateX. Keys on animation curves are identified by either their time values
    or their indices.  Times and indices can be given individually or as part of a
    list or range (see Examples). This command will return the time (in current

    keysOrObjects: Any active keys, when no target objects or -attribute flags
    appear on the command line, orAll animation curves connected to all keyframable
    attributes of objects specified as the command line's targetList, when there are

    there are no objects specified, don't do anything. Note that the -animationflag
    can be used to override the curves uniquely identified by the multi-use
    -attributeflag, which takes an argument of the form attributeName, such as
    translateX. Keys on animation curves are identified by either their time values

    - forceElement : fe              (PyNode)        [edit]
        For use in edit mode only. Forces addition of the items to the set. If the items
        are in another set which is in the same partition as the given set, the items

    - minimizeRotation : mr          (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        This flag only affects the attribute contained in the immediate keyingGroup. It
        does not affect attributes in sub-keyingGroups. Those will need to set
        minimizeRotation on their respective keyingGroups
    
    - name : n                       (unicode)       [create]

    - noSurfaceShader : nss          (bool)          [create]
        If set is renderable, do not connect it to the default surface shader.  Flag has
        no meaning or effect for non renderable sets. This flag is for use in creation
        mode only. The default value is false.
    
    - noWarnings : nw                (bool)          [create]

    - nodesOnly : no                 (bool)          [query]
        This flag is usable with the -q/query flag but is ignored if used with another
        queryable flags. This flag modifies the results of the set membership query such
        that when there are attributes (e.g. sphere1.tx) or components of nodes included
        in the set, only the nodes will be listed. Each node will only be listed once,
        even if more than one attribute or component of the node exists in the set.
    
    - remove : rm                    (PyNode)        [edit]

    - renderable : r                 (bool)          [create,query]
        This flag indicates that a special type of set should be created. This type of
        set (shadingEngine as opposed to objectSet) has certain restrictions on its
        membership in that it can only contain renderable elements such as lights and
        geometry. These sets are referred to as shading groups and are automatically
        connected to the renderPartitionnode when created (to ensure mutual exclusivity
        of the set's members with the other sets in the partition). This flag is for use
        in creation or query mode only. The default value is false which means a normal
        set is created.
    
    - setActiveFilter : fil          (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Sets the global, active keying group filter, which will affect activation of
        keying groups. Only keying groups with categories that match the filter will be
        activated. If the setActiveFilter is set to NoKeyingGroups, keying groups will
        not be activated at all. If the setActiveFilter is set to AllKeyingGroups, we
        will activate any keying group rather than just those with matching categories.
    
    - size : s                       (bool)          [query]
        Use the size flag to query the length of the set.

        items from the given set.
    
    - subtract : sub                 (PyNode)        [create]
        An operation between two sets which returns the members of the first set that
        are not in the second set.
    
    - text : t                       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Defines an annotation string to be stored with the set.
    
    - union : un                     (PyNode)        [create]
        An operation that returns a list of all the members of all sets listed.
    
    - vertices : v                   (bool)          [create,query]
        Indicates the new set can contain vertices only. This flag is for use in
        creation or query mode only. The default value is false.                  Flag
        can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

def bakeDeformer(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    Given a rigged character, whose mesh shape is determined by a set of deformers,
    bakeDeformer calculates linear blend skin weights most closely approximating
    observed deformations. To do this, a test set of examples is generated by moving
    the rig through a range of motion. Results mesh and pose pairs are then used to
    solve a constrained optimization, solving for skinning weights. bakeDeformer
    automatically binds and applies resulting weights to the destination geometry.
    If the source and destination mesh/skeleton are identical, the command will
    replace the original deformations with a skinCluster and computed weights. See
    the below examples for sample usage.
    
    Flags:
    - colorizeSkeleton : cs          (bool)          [create]
        The new skin cluster created will have its skeleton colorized. Must be used with
        the -srcSkeletonName and -dstSkeletonName flags.
    
    - customRangeOfMotion : rom      (timerange)     [create]
        When this flag is specified with the frames for the range of motion to be used,
        the tool will step through each frame as a separate pose. Otherwise the tool
        will use the existing range of motion in the tool that rotates each influence 45
        degrees. Usage examples:     -rom 10:20means all frames in the range from 10 to
        20, inclusive, in the current time unit. Omitting one end of a range means using
        either end of the animation range (or both), as in the following examples: -rom
        10:means all frames from time 10 (in the current time unit) onwards to the
        maximum time in the animation range (on the timeline). -rom :10means all frames
        from the minimum time on the animation range (on the timeline) up to (and
        including) time 10 (in the current time unit). -rom :is a short form to specify
        all frames, from minimum to maximum time on the current animation range. When
        using this flag, some of the joints in the specified range of motion may not
        have changed sufficiently. To improve bakeDeformer results or avoid algorithm
        errors, the command will return a list of influences that do not move enough in
        the specified range of motion. To detect these joints, the localtransformation
        of each joint is compared between subsequent frames. We consider that a joint
        has sufficiently changed if any of the below criteria are met:     There is a
        rotation of at least 5 degrees, as determined by the shortest rotation between
        transforms.There is a translation of 1% or greater of the size of the largest
        bounding box containing all joints for each frame.There is a scaling change of
        at least 1%. This percentage represents the smallest scaling value over the
        largest scaling value (in absolute value).If a joint has not met any of the
        criteria, it will be added to the warning of joints that have not moved enough.
        The custom range of motion should be considered experimental.

        the upVector is aligned with the up axis of the scene and worldUpVector and

        closely as possible to the origin of the space of the worldUpObject and the
        worldUpVector is ignored. If the value is objectrotationthen the worldUpVector
        is interpreted as being in the coordinate space of the worldUpObject,

        to the result. If the value is vector, the upVector is aligned with
        worldUpVector as closely as possible and worldUpMatrix is ignored. Finally, if
        the value is noneno twist calculation is performed by the constraint, with the
        resulting upVectororientation based previous orientation of the constrained
        object, and the great circlerotation needed to align the aim vector with its
        constraint. The default worldUpType is vector.

        sculpting primitve. The choices are: ring | even. The default is even. When
        queried, this flag returns a string. Ring mode will tend to produce a contour
        like ring of points around the sculpt object as it passes through an object
        while even mode will try to spread the points out as evenly as possible across
        the surface of the sculpt object.

        This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed
        ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but
        not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the

    - rounding : ro                  (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Affects the bulging of lattice points on the outside of the bend.
        Positive/negative values cause the points to bulge outwards/inwards. Default

    Flags:
    - after : af                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new

        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - afterReference : ar            (bool)          [create,edit]
        The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way
        that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being
        deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new
        deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using
        -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the
        deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to
        lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
    
    - before : bf                    (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new

    - bindState : bs                 (bool)          [create]
        Specifying this flag adds in a compensation to ensure the softModed objects
        preserve their spatial position when softModed. This is required to prevent the
        geometry from jumping at the time the softMod is created in situations when the
        softMod transforms at softMod time are not identity.
    
    - curveInterpolation : ci        (int)           [create]
        Ramp interpolation corresponding to the specified curvePoint position. Integer
        values of 0-3 are valid, corresponding to none, linear, smoothand

    - frontOfChain : foc             (bool)          [create,edit]
        This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed
        ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but
        not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the
        upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this
        flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset
        (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - geometry : g                   (unicode)       [query,edit]
        The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this
        deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag
        returns string string string ...
    
    - geometryIndices : gi           (bool)          [query]
        Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each

    - parallel : par                 (bool)          [create,edit]
        Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the
        history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results
        together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry
        added yet).
    
    - prune : pr                     (bool)          [edit]
        Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current
        configuration from the deformer set.
    
    - relative : rel                 (bool)          [create]
        Enable relative mode for the softMod. In relative mode, Only the transformations
        directly above the softMod are used by the softMod. Default is off.
    
    - remove : rm                    (bool)          [edit]
        Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this
        deformer.
    
    - resetGeometry : rg             (bool)          [edit]
        Reset the geometry matrices for the objects being deformed by the softMod. This
        flag is used to get rid of undesirable effects that happen if you scale an
        object that is deformed by a softMod.
    
    - split : sp                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending
        the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if
        the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - weightedNode : wn              (unicode, unicode) [create,query,edit]
        Transform node in the DAG above the softMod to which all percents are applied.
        The second node specifies the descendent of the first node from where the
        transformation matrix is evaluated. Default is the softMod handle.
        Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    - atPose : ap                    (bool)          [query]
        Query whether the hierarchy is at same position as the pose. Names of hierarchy
        members that are not at the pose position will be returned. An empty return list
        indicates that the hierarchy is at the pose.
    
    - bindPose : bp                  (bool)          [create,query]
        Used to specify the bindPose for the selected hierarchy. Each hierarchy can have
        only a single bindPose, which is saved automatically at the time of a skin bind.
        The bindPose is used when adding influence objects, binding new skins, or adding
        flexors. Take care when modifying the bindPose with the -rs/-reset or
        -rm/-remove flags, since if the bindPose is ill-defined it can cause problems
        with subsequent skinning operations.
    
    - g : g                          (bool)          [create]
        This flag can be used in conjunction with the restore flag to signal that the

        not only is each object locally oriented with respect to its parents, it is also
        in the same global position that it was at when the pose was saved. If a
        hierarchy's parenting has been changed since the time that the pose was saved,
        you may have trouble reaching the global pose.
    
    - members : m                    (bool)          [query]

    - reset : rs                     (bool)          [create]
        Reset the pose on the selected joints. If you are resetting pose data for a
        bindPose, take care. It is appropriate to use the -rs/-reset flag if a joint has
        been reparented and/or appears to be exactly at the bindPose. However, a
        bindPose that is much different from the exact bindPose can cause problems with
        subsequent skinning operations.
    
    - restore : r                    (bool)          [create]
        Restore the hierarchy to a saved pose. To specify the pose, select the pose
        node, or use the -bp/-bindPose or -n/-name flag.

    -lowBoundand -highBoundmay be used to initialize, edit or query those attribute
    values on the bend node. Examples of this are covered in the example section
    below.
    
    Flags:
    - after : af                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new
        geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - afterReference : ar            (bool)          [create,edit]
        The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way
        that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being
        deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new
        deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using
        -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the
        deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to
        lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
    
    - autoParent : ap                (bool)          [create]
        Parents the deformer handle under the selected object's transform. This flag is
        valid only when a single object is selected.
    
    - before : bf                    (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new
        geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - commonParent : cp              (bool)          [create]
        Creates a new transform and parents the selected object and the deformer handle
        under it.  This flag is valid only when a single object is selected.
    
    - defaultScale : ds              (bool)          [create]
        Sets the scale of the deformation handle to 1.  By default the deformation
        handle is scaled to the match the largest dimension of the selected objects'
        bounding box. [deformerFlags] The attributes of the deformer handle shape can be
        set upon creation, edited and queried as normal flags using either the long or
        the short attribute name.  e.g.
    
    - deformerTools : dt             (bool)          [query]
        Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
    
    - exclusive : ex                 (unicode)       [create,query]
        Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
    
    - frontOfChain : foc             (bool)          [create,edit]
        This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed
        ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but
        not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the
        upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this
        flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset
        (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - geometry : g                   (unicode)       [query,edit]
        The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this
        deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag
        returns string string string ...
    
    - geometryIndices : gi           (bool)          [query]
        Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each
        geometry.
    
    - ignoreSelected : ignoreSelected (bool)          [create]
        Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
    
    - includeHiddenSelections : ihs  (bool)          [create]
        Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list.
        Default is false.
    
    - name : n                       (unicode)       [create]
        Used to specify the name of the node being created.
    
    - parallel : par                 (bool)          [create,edit]
        Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the
        history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results
        together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry
        added yet).
    
    - prune : pr                     (bool)          [edit]
        Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current
        configuration from the deformer set.
    
    - remove : rm                    (bool)          [edit]
        Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this
        deformer.
    
    - split : sp                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending
        the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if
        the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - type : typ                     (unicode)       [create]
        Specifies the type of deformation. The current valid deformation types are:
        bend, twist, squash, flare, sine and wave                  Flag can have
        multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

def blendTwoAttr(*args, **kwargs):

    blendFunction \* input[1] The blendTwoAttr command can be used to blend the
    animation of an object to transition smoothly between the animation of two other
    objects. When the blendTwoAttr command is issued, it creates a blendTwoAttr node
    on the specified attributes, and reconnects whatever was previously connected to
    the attributes to the new blend nodes. You may also specify which two attributes
    should be used to blend together. The driver is used when you want to keyframe
    an object after it is being animated by a blend node. The current driver index
    specifies which of the two blended attributes should be keyframed.

        created blendTwoAttr node(s) blender attribute. This attribute controls how much
        of each of the two attributes to use in the blend. If this flag is not
        specified, a new animation curve is created whose value goes from 1 to 0
        throughout the time range specified by the -t flag. If -t is not specified, an
        abrupt change from the value of the first to the value of the second attribute
        will occur at the current time when this command is issued.

    This command creates a lattice deformer that will deform the selected objects.
    If the object centered flag is used, the initial lattice will fit around the
    selected objects. The lattice will be selected when the command is completed.
    The lattice deformer has an associated base lattice. Only objects which are
    contained by the base lattice will be deformed by the lattice.
    
    Flags:
    - after : af                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new
        geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and

        The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way
        that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being
        deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new
        deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using
        -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the
        deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to
        lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
    
    - before : bf                    (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is

        upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this
        flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset
        (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - geometry : g                   (unicode)       [query,edit]
        The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this
        deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag
        returns string string string ...
    
    - geometryIndices : gi           (bool)          [query]
        Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each
        geometry.
    
    - ignoreSelected : ignoreSelected (bool)          [create]
        Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
    
    - includeHiddenSelections : ihs  (bool)          [create]
        Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list.
        Default is false.
    
    - latticeReset : lr              (bool)          [edit]
        Reset the lattice to match its base position. This will undo any deformations
        that the lattice is causing. The lattice will only deform points that are
        enclosed within the lattice's reset (base) position.
    
    - ldivisions : ldv               (int, int, int) [create,query,edit]
        Set the number of local lattice slices in x, y, z.
    
    - name : n                       (unicode)       [create]
        Used to specify the name of the node being created.
    
    - objectCentered : oc            (bool)          [create]
        Centers the lattice around the selected object(s) or components. Default is off
        which centers the lattice at the origin.
    
    - outsideFalloffDistance : ofd   (float)         [create]
        Set the falloff distance used when the setting for transforming points outside
        of the base lattice is set to 2. The distance value is a positive number which
        specifies the size of the falloff distance as a multiple of the base lattice
        size, thus a value of 1.0 specifies that only points up to the base lattice
        width/height/depth away are transformed. A value of 0.0 is equivalent to an
        outsideLattice value of 0 (i.e. no points outside the base lattice are
        transformed). A huge value is equivalent to transforming an outsideLattice value
        of 1 (i.e. all points are transformed).
    
    - outsideLattice : ol            (int)           [create]
        Set the mode describing how points outside the base lattice are transformed. 0
        (the default) specifies that no outside points are transformed. 1 specifies that
        all outside points are transformed, and 2 specifies that only those outside
        points which fall within the falloff distance(see the
        -ofd/outsideFalloffDistance flag) are transformed. When querying, the current
        setting for the lattice is returned.
    
    - parallel : par                 (bool)          [create,edit]
        Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the
        history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results
        together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry
        added yet).
    
    - position : pos                 (float, float, float) [create]
        Used to specify the position of the newly created lattice.
    
    - prune : pr                     (bool)          [edit]
        Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current
        configuration from the deformer set.
    
    - remove : rm                    (bool)          [edit]
        Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this
        deformer.
    
    - removeTweaks : rt              (bool)          [edit]
        Remove any lattice deformations caused by moving lattice points.
        Translations/rotations and scales on the lattice itself are not removed.
    
    - rotation : ro                  (float, float, float) [create]
        Used to specify the initial rotation of the newly created lattice.
    
    - scale : s                      (float, float, float) [create]
        Used to specify the initial scale of the newly created lattice.
    
    - split : sp                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending
        the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if
        the deformer has no geometry added yet).                  Flag can have multiple
        arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

def choice(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The choice command provides a mechanism for changing the inputs to an attribute
    based on some (usually time-based) criteria. For example, an object could be
    animated from frames 1 to 30 by a motion path, then from frames 30 to 50 it
    follows keyframe animation, and after frame 50 it returns to the motion path.
    Or, a revolve surface could change its input curve depending on some transform's
    rotation value.The choice command creates a choice node (if one does not already
    exist) on all specified attributes of the selected objects. If the attribute was
    already connected to something, that something is now reconnected to the i'th
    index of the choice node's input (or the next available input if the -in/index
    flag is not specified). If a source attribute is specified, then that attribute
    is connected to the choice node's i'th input instead.The choice node operates by
    using the value of its selector attribute to determine which of its input
    attributes to pass through to its output. The input attributes can be of any
    type. For example, if the selector attribute was connected by an animation curve
    with keyframes at (1,1), (30,2) and (50,1), then that would mean that the choice
    node would pass on the data from input[1] from time 1 to 30, and after time 50,
    and the data from input[2] between times 30 and 50.This command returns the
    names of the created or modified choice nodes, and if a keyframe was added to

    -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset
    and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one column in any group can be adjustable. This
    command creates, edits, queries a keyframe stats control.

    - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL
        version of the callback is of the form: global proc string[] callbackName(string
        $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that is
        transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array
        describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined
        drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
        CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3
        == CTRL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the
        callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
        argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def
        callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The values of these arguments are
        the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the
        callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the
        string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format
        operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys
        dragControl, x, y, modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other
        values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s
        %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
    - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above
        the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form: global proc
        callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x,
        int $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the
        drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined
        message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the
        callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python,
        it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended
        way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the
        Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the
        same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback
        in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will
        have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.
        The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the
        other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
        '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
    - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the

        values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag
        would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that
        get it by default, like Edit and List controls
    
    - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]

        obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by
        some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
        window is invisible or iconified.
    
    - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it
        take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
    
    - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
        Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should
        not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of
        this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
    - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
        Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

        Controls the number of digits to the right of the decimal point that will be
        displayed for float-valued channels. Default is 3.  Queried, returns an int.
    
    - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's
        right mouse button menu.

    - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.
        Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state
        of its parent layout(s).
    
    - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
        Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
    
    - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]

    - absolute : a                   (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The joint center position is in absolute world coordinates. (This is the
        default.)
    
    - angleX : ax                    (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Set the x-axis angle. When queried, this flag returns a float.
    
    - angleY : ay                    (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Set the y-axis angle. When queried, this flag returns a float.
    
    - angleZ : az                    (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Set the z-axis angle. When queried, this flag returns a float.
    
    - assumePreferredAngles : apa    (bool)          [edit]
        Meaningful only in the edit mode. It sets the joint angles to the corresponding
        preferred angles.
    
    - automaticLimits : al           (bool)          [create]
        Meaningful only in edit mode. It sets the joint to appropriate hinge joint with
        joint limits. It modifies the joint only if (a) it connects exactly to two
        joints (one parent, one child), (b) it does not lie on the line drawn between
        the two connected joints, and the plane it forms with the two connected joints
        is perpendicular to one of its rotation axes.
    
    - children : ch                  (bool)          [edit]
        It tells the command to apply all the edit options not only to the selected
        joints, but also to their descendent joints in the DAG.
    
    - component : co                 (bool)          [create,edit]
        Use with the -position switch to position the joint relative to its parent (like
        -relative) but to compute new positions for all children joints so their world
        coordinate positions do not change.
    
    - degreeOfFreedom : dof          (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Specifies the degrees of freedom for the IK. Valid strings consist of non-
        duplicate letters from x, y, and z. The letters in the string indicate what
        rotations are to be used by IK. The order a letter appear in the string does not
        matter. Examples are x, yz, xyz. When queried, this flag returns a string.
        Modifying dof will change the locking state of the corresponding rotation
        attributes. The rule is: if an rotation is turned into a dof, it will be
        unlocked if it is currently locked. When it is turned into a non-dof, it will be
        locked if it is not currently locked.
    
    - exists : ex                    (unicode)       [query]
        Does the named joint exist? When queried, this flag returns a boolean.
    
    - limitSwitchX : lsx             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Use the limit the x-axis rotation? When queried, this flag returns a boolean.
    
    - limitSwitchY : lsy             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Use the limit the y-axis rotation? When queried, this flag returns a boolean.
    
    - limitSwitchZ : lsz             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Use the Limit the z-axis rotation? When queried, this flag returns a boolean.
    
    - limitX : lx                    (float, float)  [create,query,edit]
        Set lower and upper limits on the x-axis of rotation.  Also turns on the joint
        limit. When queried, this flag returns 2 floats.
    
    - limitY : ly                    (float, float)  [create,query,edit]
        Set lower and upper limits on the y-axis of rotation.  Also turns on the joint
        limit. When queried, this flag returns 2 floats.
    
    - limitZ : lz                    (float, float)  [create,query,edit]
        Set lower and upper limits on the z-axis of rotation.  Also turns on the joint
        limit. When queried, this flag returns 2 floats.
    
    - name : n                       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Specifies the name of the joint. When queried, this flag returns a string.
    
    - orientJoint : oj               (unicode)       [edit]
        The argument can be one of the following strings: xyz, yzx, zxy, zyx, yxz, xzy,
        none. It modifies the joint orientation and scale orientation so that the axis
        indicated by the first letter in the argument will be aligned with the vector
        from this joint to its first child joint. For example, if the argument is xyz,
        the x-axis will point towards the child joint. The alignment of the remaining
        two joint orient axes are dependent on whether or not the
        -sao/-secondaryAxisOrient flag is used. If the -sao flag is used, see the
        documentation for that flag for how the remaining axes are aligned. In the
        absence of a user specification for the secondary axis orientation, the rotation
        axis indicated by the last letter in the argument will be aligned with the
        vector perpendicular to first axis and the vector from this joint to its parent
        joint. The remaining axis is aligned according the right hand rule. If the
        argument is none, the joint orientation will be set to zero and its effect to
        the hierarchy below will be offset by modifying the scale orientation. The flag
        will be ignored if: A. the joint has non-zero rotations when the argument is not
        none. B. the joint does not have child joint, or the distance to the child joint
        is zero when the argument is not none. C. either flag -o or -so is set.
    
    - orientation : o                (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
        The joint orientation. When queried, this flag returns 3 floats.
    
    - position : p                   (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
        Specifies the position of the center of the joint. This position may be relative
        to the joint's parent or in absolute world coordinates (see -r and -a below).
        When queried, this flag returns 3 floats.
    
    - radius : rad                   (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Specifies the joint radius.
    
    - relative : r                   (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The joint center position is relative to the joint's parent.
    
    - rotationOrder : roo            (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        The rotation order of the joint. The argument can be one of the following
        strings: xyz, yzx, zxy, zyx, yxz, xzy.
    
    - scale : s                      (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
        Scale of the joint. When queried, this flag returns 3 floats.
    
    - scaleCompensate : sc           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        It sets the scaleCompenstate attribute of the joint to the given argument. When
        this is true, the scale of the parent joint will be compensated before any
        rotation of this joint is applied, so that the bone to the joint is scaled but
        not the bones to its child joints. When queried, this flag returns an boolean.
    
    - scaleOrientation : so          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
        Set the orientation of the coordinate axes for scaling. When queried, this flag
        returns 3 floats.
    
    - secondaryAxisOrient : sao      (unicode)       [edit]
        The argument can be one of the following strings: xup, xdown, yup, ydown, zup,
        zdown, none. This flag is used in conjunction with the -oj/orientJoint flag. It
        specifies the scene axis that the second axis should align with. For example, a
        flag combination of -oj yzx -sao yupwould result in the y-axis pointing down the
        bone, the z-axis oriented with the scene's positive y-axis, and the x-axis
        oriented according to the right hand rule.
    
    - setPreferredAngles : spa       (bool)          [edit]
        Meaningful only in the edit mode. It sets the preferred angles to the current
        joint angles.
    
    - stiffnessX : stx               (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Set the stiffness (from 0 to 100.0) for x-axis. When queried, this flag returns
        a float.
    
    - stiffnessY : sty               (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Set the stiffness (from 0 to 100.0) for y-axis. When queried, this flag returns
        a float.
    
    - stiffnessZ : stz               (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Set the stiffness (from 0 to 100.0) for z-axis. When queried, this flag returns
        a float.
    
    - symmetry : sym                 (bool)          [create,edit]
        Create a symmetric joint from the current joint.
    
    - symmetryAxis : sa              (unicode)       [create,edit]
        This flag specifies the axis used to mirror symmetric joints. Any combination of
        x, y, z can be used. This option is only used when the symmetry flag is set to
        True.
    
    - zeroScaleOrient : zso          (bool)          [edit]
        It sets the scale orientation to zero and compensate the change by modifing the
        translation and joint orientation for joint or rotation for general transform of
        all its child transformations. The flag will be ignored if the flag -so is set.
        Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    - frontOfChain : foc             (bool)          [create,edit]
        This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed
        ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but
        not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the
        upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this
        flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset
        (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).

        Affects the location of lattice points along the upper half of the bone.
        Positive/negative values cause the points to move away/towards the center of the
        bone.  Changing this parameter also modifies the regions affected by the
        creasing, rounding and width parameters. Default value is 0.0. When queried,
        this flag returns a float.

    - parallel : par                 (bool)          [create,edit]
        Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the
        history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results
        together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry
        added yet).

        Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current
        configuration from the deformer set.
    
    - remove : rm                    (bool)          [edit]
        Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this

        Specifies which dag node is being used to rigidly transform the lattice which
        this node is going to deform.  If this flag is not specified an identity matrix
        will be assumed.

        constraint. The two arguments define the start and end frames.  The cache is
        useful if the constraint has multiple targets and the constraint's interpolation
        type is set to no flip. The no flipmode prevents flipping during playback, but
        the result is dependent on the previous frame. Therefore in order to
        consistently get the same result on a specific frame, a cache must be generated.
        This flag creates the cache and sets the constraint's interpolation type to
        cache. If a cache exists already, it will be deleted and replaced with a new
        cache.
    
    - decompRotationToChild : dr     (bool)          [create]
        During constraint creation, if the rotation offset between the constrained
        object and the target object is maintained, this flag indicates close to which
        object the offset rotation is decomposed. Setting this flag will make the
        rotation decomposition close to the constrained object instead of the target
        object, which is the default setting.
    
    - deleteCache : dc               (bool)          [edit]
        Delete an existing interpolation cache.
    
    - layer : l                      (unicode)       [create,edit]
        Specify the name of the animation layer where the constraint should be added.
    
    - maintainOffset : mo            (bool)          [create]
        If this flag is specified the position and rotation of the constrained object
        will be maintained.
    
    - name : n                       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
        Sets the name of the constraint node to the specified name.  Default name is
        constrainedObjectName_constraintType
    
    - remove : rm                    (bool)          [edit]
        removes the listed target(s) from the constraint.
    
    - skipRotate : sr                (unicode)       [create]
        Causes the axis specified not to be considered when constraining rotation.
        Valid arguments are x, y, zand none.
    
    - skipTranslate : st             (unicode)       [create]
        Causes the axis specified not to be considered when constraining translation.
        Valid arguments are x, y, zand none.
    
    - targetList : tl                (bool)          [query]
        Return the list of target objects.
    
    - weight : w                     (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Sets the weight value for the specified target(s). If not given at creation
        time, the default value of 1.0 is used.
    
    - weightAliasList : wal          (bool)          [query]
        Returns the names of the attributes that control the weight of the target
        objects. Aliases are returned in the same order as the targets are returned by
        the targetList flag                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed
        either as a tuple or a list.

    This command is used to create, edit and query deltaMush nodes.
    
    Flags:
    - after : af                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new
        geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - afterReference : ar            (bool)          [create,edit]
        The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way
        that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being
        deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new
        deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using
        -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the
        deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to
        lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
    
    - before : bf                    (bool)          [create,edit]
        If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is
        not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to
        place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new
        geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - deformerTools : dt             (bool)          [query]
        Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
    
    - envelope : en                  (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Envelope of the delta mush node. The envelope determines the percent of
        deformation. Value is clamped to [0, 1] range. Default is 1.
    
    - exclusive : ex                 (unicode)       [create,query]
        Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
    
    - frontOfChain : foc             (bool)          [create,edit]
        This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed
        ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but
        not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the
        upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this
        flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset
        (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - geometry : g                   (unicode)       [query,edit]
        The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this
        deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag
        returns string string string ...
    
    - geometryIndices : gi           (bool)          [query]
        Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each
        geometry.
    
    - ignoreSelected : ignoreSelected (bool)          [create]
        Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
    
    - includeHiddenSelections : ihs  (bool)          [create]
        Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list.
        Default is false.
    
    - inwardConstraint : iwc         (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Constrains the movement of the vertex to not move inward from the input
        deforming shape to preserve the contour. Value is in the [0,1] range. Default is
        0.0.
    
    - name : n                       (unicode)       [create]
        Used to specify the name of the node being created.
    
    - outwardConstraint : owc        (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Constrains the movement of the vertex to not move outward from the input
        deforming shape to preserve the contour. Value is in the [0,1] range. Default is
        0.0.
    
    - parallel : par                 (bool)          [create,edit]
        Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the
        history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results
        together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry
        added yet).
    
    - pinBorderVertices : pbv        (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        If enabled, vertices on mesh borders will be pinned to their current position
        during smoothing. Default is true.
    
    - prune : pr                     (bool)          [edit]
        Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current
        configuration from the deformer set.
    
    - remove : rm                    (bool)          [edit]
        Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this
        deformer.
    
    - smoothingIterations : si       (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Number of smoothing iterations performed by the delta mush node. Default is 10.
    
    - smoothingStep : ss             (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Step amount used per smoothing iteration. Value is clamped to [0, 1] range. A
        higher value may lead to instabilities but converges faster compared to a lower
        value. Default is 0.5.
    
    - split : sp                     (bool)          [create,edit]
        Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending
        the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if
        the deformer has no geometry added yet).                  Flag can have multiple
        arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

        version of the callback is of the form: global proc string[] callbackName(string
        $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that is
        transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array
        describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined
        drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
        CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3
        == CTRL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the
        callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
        argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def
        callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The values of these arguments are
        the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the
        callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the
        string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format
        operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys
        dragControl, x, y, modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other
        values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s
        %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
    - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above
        the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form: global proc
        callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x,
        int $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the
        drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined
        message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the
        callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python,
        it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended
        way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the
        Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the
        same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback
        in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will
        have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.
        The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the

    - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
        Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be
        obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by
        some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's

    - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it
        take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
    
    - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
        Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should
        not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of
        this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
    - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
        Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

        If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's
        right mouse button menu.
    
    - statusBarMessage : sbm         (unicode)       [create,edit]
        Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
    
    - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
        Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
    - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.
        Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state
        of its parent layout(s).

        the bake process. This is a multi-use flag. Its name refers to the fact that
        when solving for the value to key, it determines the proper value to key on the
        destination layer to achieve the same result as the merged layers.
    
    - sampleBy : sb                  (time)          [create]
        Amount to sample by. Default is 1.0 in current timeUnit
    
    - shape : s                      (bool)          [create]
        Consider attributes of shapes below transforms as well, except controlPoints.
        Default: true.  (Not valid for pasteKeycmd.)
    
    - simulation : sm                (bool)          [create]
        Using this flag instructs the command to preform a simulation instead of just
        evaluating each attribute separately over the range of time. The simulation flag
        is required to bake animation that that depends on the whole scene being
        evaluated at each time step such as dynamics. The default is true.
    
    - smart : sr                     (bool, float)   [create]
        Specify whether to enable smart bake and the optional smart bake tolerance.
    
    - sparseAnimCurveBake : sac      (bool)          [create]
        When baking anim curves, do not insert any keys into areas of the curve where
        animation is defined.  And, use as few keys as possible to bake the pre and post
        infinity behaviors.  When this is false, one key will be inserted at each time
        step.  The default is false.
    
    - time : t                       (timerange)     [create]
        time uniquely representing a key (or key range) on a time-based animCurve. See
        the code examples below on how to format for a single frame or frame ranges.
        Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
