    for observers to remove themselves from ListItem subjects when they are
    about to be destroyed (in their __del__ method).  A ListItem subject
    will clean up these zombie observers on next invocation of its
    itemChanged().
    
    Notification of observers can carry information with it, by passing
    optional arguments to itemChanged() notification method.  It is therefore
    possible (though not mandatory) to define an interface for a list item
    change and all its observers so that observers use the arguments in the
    callback to understand what changed in the list item.  This implies
    that all observers must implement the same interface.  The simplest use
    is to pass in no arguments to itemChanged(), in which case observers
    can perform an overall refresh.
