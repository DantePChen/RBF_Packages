    This class represents the property editor which displays the selected render setup item's property information.
    
    
    Note: The Qt should never called any 'deferred' actions because all the design is based on synchronous notifications
          and any asynchronous events will change the order of execution of these events.
    
          For example when the selection in the Render Setup Window is changed (so the Property Editor must be updated). 
          The delete must be synchronous on the 'unselected' layouts otherwise they will be updated along with selected ones. 
          The two main side effects are that lot of unnecessary processings are triggered (those one the deleted layouts) 
          and the infamous 'C++ already deleted' issue appears because the Data Model & Qt Model objects were deleted 
          but not their corresponding Layout (instance used by the Property Editor to display a render setup object).
