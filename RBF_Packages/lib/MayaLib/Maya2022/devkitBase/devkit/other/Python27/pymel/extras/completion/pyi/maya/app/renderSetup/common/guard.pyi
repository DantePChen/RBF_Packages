"""
This module implements guards that can be used to transiently set and
restore data in an exception-safe and maintenance-friendly way.

Context objects in this module can be used in the Python 'with' statement
to ensure that finalization is always done, regardless of how the 'with'
statement code block is exited.

Decorators in this module use the context objects to provide a convenient
syntax to guard a block that is a complete function.

    Safe way to transiently set and restore an environment variable

    Safe way to transiently set and restore one or more class instance's

    The data member is specified by string name.  When used for multiple
    data members, a dictionary is given to the guard, with the keys as
    the data member string names, and the dictionary values as the new
    values.
    
    Single member example:
        obj.a = oldValue
        # Set obj.a to newValue for this scope.
        with MemberGuardCtx(obj, 'a', newValue):

        # Set obj.a and obj.b to new values for this scope.
