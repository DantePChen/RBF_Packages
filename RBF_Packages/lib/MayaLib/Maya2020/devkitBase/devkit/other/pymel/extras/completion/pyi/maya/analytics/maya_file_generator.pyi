    Generator to walk all Maya files in or below a specific directory.
    
    root_path  : Path or list of paths to walk, looking for Maya files
    skip       : A list of regular expression strings indicating path patterns
                 to skip.  Match begins anywhere in the string so the leading
                 "^" is necessary if you wish to check for a prefix. Some
                 example expressions include:
    
                 '.mb$'         : Skip all Maya Binary files

    descend    : Recurse into subdirectories
    
    Returns list of filepaths in any of the root_paths not matching the skip patterns.
    
    Usage:
    Find all Maya files under "root/projects" that aren't temporary files,
    defined as those named temp.ma, temp.mb, or that live in a temp/ subdirectory.
