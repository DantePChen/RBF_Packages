    {
        analytics      : List of names of all analytics to be run.
                         Default: [] (run all available analytics)
        descend        : If True then for all directories that are included in
                         "paths" also include all of the subdirectories below them.
                         Default: True
        force          : If True run the analytic even if up-to-date results exist.
                         Default: False
        return_json    : If True then return all JSON results from the analytics,
                         aggregated by indexing them on the file and analytic name.
                         Use with caution as long runs can make this string huge.
                         Default: False
        list_only      : True means list the analytics to be run and the files to
                         run them on without actually running the analytic.
                         Return value will be a dictionary of {FILE, [ANALYTICS]}
                         Default: False
        paths          : List of paths on which to run the analytics. If
                         any elements are directories they will be walked
                         to find matching files. Use in conjunction with
                         "descend" to find all files below a root directory.
                         Default: []
        report_progress: If True then put up a progress report dialog while
                         running. This works for the list_only mode as well
                         since that too could take some time on a large tree.
                         Default: False
        results_path   : If specified then dump the analytics with this
                         directory as the root. Otherwise use the subdirectory
                         "MayaAnalytics" in the same directory as the file(s)
                         Default: None
        skip           : List of file patterns to ignore when walking directories.
                         e.g. ".mb$" to ignore all Maya Binary files, or
                         "/reference/" to ignore everything in the subdirectory
                         named "reference". Forward-slash separator is assumed.
                         Default: []
        static         : If True then run the Static analytics, otherwise run the
                         scene-based analytics. When Static analytics are run
                         if "paths" are specified a ValueError exception is
                         raised.
                         Default: False
        logger         : Message output destination.
                         Default: message object pointing to stdout

    Analytic Options, used here and/or passed in to analytics
    Add new options by calling Runner.set_option( 'name', 'value' )
    {
        summary:    Include a summary of the output (usually a list of counts)
                    Default: False
        details:    Include full details in the output.
                    Default: False
        anonymous : True if identifying information is to be made
                    anonymous. At the top level this will include file
                    and directory names, for example, output the path
                    "dir1/dir2/file1.ma" instead of "scene1/shot2/dinosaur.ma"
                    Individual analytics may add other anonymizers, for
                    example anonymizing the names of nodes.
                    Default: False.

        you wish but the analytic is responsible for accessing it.
        
        The safe way for analytics to extract options is to override the
        analytic's set_options() method, look for the option(s) of interest,

        during the analytic's run.
