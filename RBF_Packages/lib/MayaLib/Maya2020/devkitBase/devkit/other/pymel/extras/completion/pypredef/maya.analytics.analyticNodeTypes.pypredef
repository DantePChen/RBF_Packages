    for the cases of analyzing a file that is read and analyzing the current scene.
    
    If the file is being read:
        - persistent and default nodes are defined as any node present before the
          file is loaded
        - exceptions are made if a new connection is formed to a persistent or
          default node after the file is loaded
    
    If the current scene is used:
        - persistent and default nodes are taken to be those marked as such by the
          Maya 'ls' command. This won't include any special persistent nodes
          created after-the-fact, such as those a newly loaded plug-in might create.
        - exceptions are made if there is any connection at all to these default
          or persistent nodes to a scene node.
    
    If the 'summary' option is used then the output includes a dictionary
    consisting of NODE_TYPE keys with value equal to the number of nodes of that
    type in the scene, not including default node types. Only node types with at
    least 1 node of that type are included.

    For normal output the output is a dictionary whose keys are the node types and
    the values are a list of nodes of that type. The information is put into an
    object named "node_types". This avoids the potential for a name conflict
    between the object "summary" and a node type also named "summary".
