Collection of decorators for use with Maya analaytics.
There are three decorators defined here. You should use
all three so that your decorators become easily self-documented.

    If the class does not have an ANALYTIC_LABEL attribute, it will assign
    one based on the name of the class ([Aa]nalyticXXX name is XXX) or
    report an error, depending on the configuration.
    If the class does not have an ANALYTIC_DESCRIPTION_SHORT attribute,
    it will assign one based on the Python doc string from the analytic
    class's module.
    If the class does not have an ANALYTIC_DESCRIPTION_DETAILED attribute,
    it will assign one based on the Python doc string from the analytic
    class.
