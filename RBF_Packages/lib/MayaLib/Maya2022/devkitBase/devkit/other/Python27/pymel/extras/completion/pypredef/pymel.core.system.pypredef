"""
In particular, the system module contains the functionality of maya.cmds.file. The file command should not be imported into
the default namespace because it conflicts with python's builtin file class. Since the file command has so many flags,
we decided to kill two birds with one stone: by breaking the file command down into multiple functions -- one for each
primary flag -- the resulting functions are more readable and allow the file command's functionality to be used directly
within the pymel namespace.

for example, instead of this:

    >>> res = cmds.file( 'test.ma', exportAll=1, preserveReferences=1, type='mayaAscii', force=1 ) # doctest: +SKIP

you can do this:

    >>> expFile = exportAll( 'test.ma', preserveReferences=1, force=1)

some of the new commands were changed slightly from their flag name to avoid name clashes and to add to readability:

    >>> importFile( expFile )  # flag was called import, but that's a python keyword
    >>> ref = createReference( expFile )
    >>> ref # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    FileReference(u'...test.ma', refnode=u'testRN')

Notice that the 'type' flag is set automatically for you when your path includes a '.mb' or '.ma' extension.

Paths returned by these commands are either a `Path` or a `FileReference`, so you can use object-oriented path methods with
the results::

    >>> expFile.exists()
    True
    >>> expFile.remove() # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Path('...test.ma')

        This flag is obsolete and has been replaced witht the loadReferenceDepth flag.
        When used with the -open flag, no references will be loaded. When used with

        Used to specify which references should be loaded. Valid types are all, noneand
        topOnly, which will load all references, no references and top-level references
        only, respectively. May only be used with the -o/open, -i/import, -r/reference
        or -lr/loadReference flags. When noneis used with -lr/loadReference, only path
        validation is performed. This can be used to replace a reference without
        triggering reload. Not using loadReferenceDepth will load references in the same
        loaded or unloaded state that they were in when the file was saved.
        Additionally, the -lr/loadReference flag supports a fourth type, asPrefs. This
        will force any nested references to be loaded according to the state (if any)
        stored in the current scene file, rather than according to the state saved in
        the reference file itself.
    
    - reference : dns                (bool)          [create]
        Use the default name space for import and referencing.  This is an advanced
        option.  If set, then on import or reference, Maya will attempt to place all
        nodes from the imported or referenced file directly into the root (default) name
        space, without invoking any name clash resolution algorithms.  If the names of
        any of the new objects    already exist in the root namespace, then errors will
        result. The user of this flag is responsible for creating a name clash
        resolution mechanism outside of Maya to avoid such errors. Note:This flag    is
        intended only for use with custom file translators written through    the API.
        Use at your own risk.
    
    - reference : dr                 (bool)          [create,query]
        When used in conjunction with the -reference flag, this flag determines if the
        reference is loaded, or if loading is deferred.C: The default is false.Q: When
        queried, this flag returns true if the reference is deferred, or false if the
        reference is not deferred. If this is used with -rfn/referenceNode, the -rfn
        flag must come before -q.
    
    - reference : gr                 (bool)          [create]
        Used only with the -r or the -i flag. Used to group all the imported/referenced
        items under a single transform.
    
    - reference : gl                 (bool)          [create]
        Used only with the -r and the -gr flag. Used to group the output of
        groupReference under a locator
    
    - reference : gn                 (unicode)       [create]
        Used only with the -gr flag. Optionally used to set the name of the transform
        node that the imported/referenced items will be grouped under.
    
    - reference : ns                 (unicode)       [edit]
        The namespace name to use that will group all objects during importing and
        referencing. Change the namespace used to group all the objects from the
        specified referenced file. The reference must have been created with the Using
        Namespacesoption, and must be loaded. Non-referenced nodes contained in the
        existing namespace will also be moved to the new namespace. The new namespace
        will be created by this command and can not already exist. The old namespace
        will be removed.
    
    - reference : rfn                (unicode)       [query]
        This flag is only used during queries. In MEL, if it appears before -query then
        it must be followed by the name of one of the scene's reference nodes. That will
        determine the reference to be queried by whatever flags appear after -query. If
        the named reference node does not exist within the scene the command will fail
        with an error. In Python the equivalent behavior is obtained by passing the name
        of the reference node as the flag's value. In MEL, if this flag appears after
        -query then it takes no argument and will cause the command to return the name
        of the reference node associated with the file given as the command's argument.
        If the file is not a reference or for some reason does not have a reference node
        (e.g., the user deleted it) then an empty string will be returned. If the file
        is not part of the current scene then the command will fail with an error. In
        Python the equivalent behavior is obtained by passing True as the flag's value.
        In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
    
    - reference : rpr                (unicode)       [create,query]
        The string to use as a prefix for all objects from this file. This flag has been
        replaced by -ns/namespace.
    
    - reference : sns                (unicode, unicode) [create]
        Can only be used in conjunction with the -r/reference or -i/import flags. This
        flag will replace any occurrences of a given namespace to an alternate specified
        namespace. This namespace swapwill occur as the file is referenced in. It takes
        in two string arguments. The first argument specifies the namespace to replace.
        The second argument specifies the replacement namespace. Use of this flag,
        implicitly enables the use of namespaces and cannot be used with deferReference.
    
    - reference : srf                (bool)          [create]
        Can only be used in conjunction with the -r/reference flag and the -ns/namespace
        flag (there is no prefix support). This flag modifies the '-r/reference' flag to
        indicate that all nodes within that reference should be treated as shared nodes.
        New copies    of those nodes will not be created if a copy already exists.
        Instead, the shared node will be merged with the existing node. The specifics of
        what happens when two nodes are merged depends on the node type. This flag
        cannot be used in conjunction with -shd/sharedNodes.
    
    - reference : shd                (unicode)       [create]
        This flag modifies the '-r/reference' flag to indicate that certain    types of
        nodes within that reference should be treated as shared nodes. All shared nodes
        will be placed in the default namespace. New copies of those nodes will not be
        created if a copy already exists in the default namespace, instead the shared
        node will be merged with the    existing node. The specifics of what happens
        when two nodes are merged depends on the node type. In general attribute values
        will not be merged, meaning the values set on any existing shared nodes will be
        retained, and the values of the nodes being merged in will be ignored. The valid
        options are displayLayers, shadingNetworks, renderLayersByName, and
        renderLayersById. This flag is multi-use; it may be specified multiple times to
        for example, share both display layers and shading networks. Two shading
        networks will only be merged if    they are identical: the network    of nodes
        feeding into the shading group must be arranged identically with equivalent
        nodes have the same name and node type. Additionally if a network is animated or
        contains a DAG object or expression it will not be mergeable. This flag cannot
        be used in conjunction with -srf/sharedReferenceFile.
    
    - reference : rnn                (bool)          [create]
        Used to control the return value in open, import, loadReference, and reference

    - exportAnimFromReference : rfn  (unicode)       [query]
        This flag is only used during queries. In MEL, if it appears before -query then
        it must be followed by the name of one of the scene's reference nodes. That will
        determine the reference to be queried by whatever flags appear after -query. If
        the named reference node does not exist within the scene the command will fail
        with an error. In Python the equivalent behavior is obtained by passing the name
        of the reference node as the flag's value. In MEL, if this flag appears after
        -query then it takes no argument and will cause the command to return the name
        of the reference node associated with the file given as the command's argument.
        If the file is not a reference or for some reason does not have a reference node
        (e.g., the user deleted it) then an empty string will be returned. If the file
        is not part of the current scene then the command will fail with an error. In
        Python the equivalent behavior is obtained by passing True as the flag's value.

        validation is performed. This can be used to replace a reference without
        triggering reload. Not using loadReferenceDepth will load references in the same

def referenceQuery(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this command to find out information about references and referenced nodes.
    A valid target is either a reference node, a reference file, or a referenced
    node. Some flags don't require a target, see flag descriptions for more
    information on what effect this has. When a scene contains multiple levels of
    file references, those edits which affect a nested reference may be stored on
    several different reference nodes. For example: A.ma has a reference to B.ma
    which has a reference to C.ma which contains a poly sphere (pSphere1). If you
    were to open B.ma and translate the sphere, an edit would be stored on CRN which
    refers to a node named C:pSphere1. If you were then to open A.ma and parent the
    sphere, an edit would be stored on BRN which refers to a node named
    B:C:pSphere1. It is important to note that when querying edits which affect a
    nested reference, the edits will be returned in the same format that they were
    applied. In the above example, opening A.ma and querying all edits which affect
    C.ma, would return two edits a parent edit affecting B:C:pSphere1, and a setAttr
    edit affecting C:pSphere1. Since there is currently no node named C:pSphere1
    (only B:C:pSphere1) care will have to be taken when interpreting the returned
    information. The same care should be taken when referenced DAG nodes have been
    parented or instanced. Continuing with the previous example, let's say that you
    were to open A.ma and, instead of simply parenting pSphere1, you were to
    instance it. While A.ma is open, B:C:pSphere1may now be an amibiguous name,
    replaced by |B:C:pSphere1and group1|B:C:pSphere1. However querying the edits
    which affect C.ma would still return a setAttr edit affecting C:pSphere1since it
    was applied prior to B:C:pSphere1 being instanced. Some tips: 1. Use the
    '-topReference' flag to query only those edits which were applied    from the
    currently open file. 2. Use the '-onReferenceNode' flag to limit the results to
    those edits where    are stored on a given reference node. You can then use
    various string    manipulation techniques to extrapolate the current name of any
    affected    nodes.
    
    Flags:
    - child : ch                     (bool)          [create]
        This flag modifies the '-rfn/-referenceNode' and '-f/-filename' flags to
        indicate the the children of the target reference will be returned. Returns a
        string array.
    
    - dagPath : dp                   (bool)          [create]
        This flag modifies the '-n/-nodes' flag to indicate that the names of any dag
        objects returned will include as much of the dag path as is necessary to make
        the names unique. If this flag is not present, the names returned will not
        include any dag paths.
    
    - editAttrs : ea                 (bool)          [create]
        Returns string array. A main flag used to query the edits that have been applied
        to the target. Only the names of the attributes involved in the reference edit
        will be returned. If an edit involves multiple attributes (e.g.
        connectAttredits) the nodes will be returned as separate, consecutive entries in
        the string array. A valid target is either a reference node, a reference file,
        or a referenced node. If a referenced node is specified, only those edits which
        affect that node will be returned. If a reference file or reference node is
        specified any edit which affects a node in that reference will be returned. If
        no target is specified all edits are returned. This command can be used on both
        loaded and unloaded references. By default it will return all the edits,
        formatted as MEL commands, which apply to the target. This flag can be used in
        combination with the '-ea/-editAttrs' flag to indicate that the names of both
        the involved nodes and attributes will be returned in the format
        'node.attribute'.
    
    - editCommand : ec               (unicode)       [create,query]
        This is a secondary flag used to indicate which type of reference edits should
        be considered by the command. If this flag is not specified all edit types will
        be included. This flag requires a string parameter. Valid values are: addAttr,
        connectAttr, deleteAttr, disconnectAttr, parent, setAttr, lockand unlock. In
        some contexts, this flag may be specified more than once to specify multiple
        edit types to consider.
    
    - editNodes : en                 (bool)          [create]
        Returns string array. A main flag used to query the edits that have been applied
        to the target. Only the names of the nodes involved in the reference edit will
        be returned. If an edit involves multiple nodes (e.g. connectAttredits) the
        nodes will be returned as separate, consecutive entries in the string array. A
        valid target is either a reference node, a reference file, or a referenced node.
        If a referenced node is specified, only those edits which affect that node will
        be returned. If a reference file or reference node is specified any edit which
        affects a node in that reference will be returned. If no target is specified all
        edits are returned. This command can be used on both loaded and unloaded
        references. By default it will return all the edits, formatted as MEL commands,
        which apply to the target. This flag can be used in combination with the
        '-ea/-editAttrs' flag to indicate that the names of both the involved nodes and
        attributes will be returned in the format 'node.attribute'.
    
    - editStrings : es               (bool)          [create]
        Returns string array. A main flag used to query the edits that have been applied
        to the target. The edit will be returned as a valid MEL command. A valid target
        is either a reference node, a reference file, or a referenced node. If a
        referenced node is specified, only those edits which affect that node will be
        returned. If a reference file or reference node is specified any edit which
        affects a node in that reference will be returned. If no target is specified all
        edits are returned. This command can be used on both loaded and unloaded
        references. By default it will return all the edits, formatted as MEL commands,
        which apply to the target. This flag cannot be used with either the
        '-en/-editNodes' or '-ea/-editAttrs' flags.
    
    - failedEdits : fld              (bool)          [create]
        This is a secondary flag used to indicate whether or not failed edits should be
        acted on (e.g. queried, removed, etc...). A failed edit is an edit which could
        not be successfully applied the last time its reference was loaded. An edit can
        fail for a variety of reasons (e.g. the referenced node to which it applies was
        removed from the referenced file). By default failed edits will not be acted on.
    
    - filename : f                   (bool)          [create]
        Returns string. A main flag used to query the filename associated with the
        target reference.
    
    - isExportEdits : iee            (bool)          [create]
        Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified reference node or file name
        is an edits file (created with the Export Edits feature)
    
    - isLoaded : il                  (bool)          [create]
        Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified reference node or file name
        refers to a loaded or unloaded reference.
    
    - isNodeReferenced : inr         (bool)          [create]
        Returns boolean. A main flag used to determine whether or not the target node
        comes from a referenced file. true if the target node comes from a referenced
        file, false if not.
    
    - isPreviewOnly : ipo            (bool)          [create]
        Returns boolean. This flag is used to determine whether or not the target
        reference node is only a preview reference node.
    
    - liveEdits : le                 (bool)          [create]
        Specifies that the edits should be returned based on the live edits database.
        Only valid when used in conjunction with the editStrings flag.
    
    - namespace : ns                 (bool)          [create]
        Returns string. This flag returns the full namespace path of the target
        reference, starting from the root namespace :. It can be combined with the
        shortName flag to return just the base name of the namespace.
    
    - nodes : n                      (bool)          [create]
        Returns string array. A main flag used to query the contents of the target
        reference.
    
    - onReferenceNode : orn          (unicode)       [create,query]
        This is a secondary flag used to indicate that only those edits which are stored
        on the indicated reference node should be considered. This flag only supports
        multiple uses when specified with the exportEditscommand.
        Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
    - parent : p                     (bool)          [create]
        This flag modifies the '-rfn/-referenceNode' and '-f/-filename' flags to
        indicate the the parent of the target reference will be returned.
    
    - parentNamespace : pns          (bool)          [create]
        A main flag used to query and return the parent namespace of the target
        reference.
    
    - referenceNode : rfn            (bool)          [create]
        Returns string. A main flag used to query the reference node associated with the
        target reference.
    
    - shortName : shn                (bool)          [create]
        This flag modifies the '-f/-filename' and '-ns/-namespace' flags. Used with the
        '-f/-filename' flag indicates that the file name returned will be the short name
        (i.e. just a file name without any directory paths). If this flag is not
        present, the full name and directory path will be returned. Used with the
        '-ns/-namespace' flag indicates that the namespace returned will be the base
        name of the namespace. (i.e. the base name of the full namespace path
        :AAA:BBB:CCCis CCC
    
    - showDagPath : sdp              (bool)          [create]
        Shows/hides the full dag path for edits. If false only displays the node-name of
        reference edits. Must be used with the -editNodes, -editStrings or -editAttrs
        flag.
    
    - showNamespace : sns            (bool)          [create]
        Shows/hides the namespaces on nodes in the reference edits. Must be used with
        the -editNodes, -editStrings or -editAttrs flag
    
    - successfulEdits : scs          (bool)          [create]
        This is a secondary flag used to indicate whether or not successful edits should
        be acted on (e.g. queried, removed, etc...). A successful edit is any edit which
        was successfully applied the last time its reference was loaded. By default
        successful edits will be acted on.
    
    - topReference : tr              (bool)          [create]
        This flag modifies the '-rfn/-referenceNode' flag to indicate the top level
        ancestral reference of the target reference will be returned.
    
    - unresolvedName : un            (bool)          [create]
        This flag modifies the '-f/-filename' flag to indicate that the file name
        returned will be unresolved (i.e. it will be the path originally specified when
        the file was loaded into Maya; this path may contain environment variables and
        may not exist on disk). If this flag is not present, the resolved name will
        be returned.
    
    - withoutCopyNumber : wcn        (bool)          [create]
        This flag modifies the '-f/-filename' flag to indicate that the file name
        returned will not have a copy number (e.g. '{1}') appended to the end. If this
        flag is not present, the file name returned may have a copy number appended to
        the end.

        $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that is
        transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array
        describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined
        drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
        CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3
        == CTRL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the
        callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
        argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def
        callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The values of these arguments are
        the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the
        callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the
        string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format
        operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys
        dragControl, x, y, modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other
        values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s
        %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
    - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
        Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above
        the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form: global proc
        callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x,
        int $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the
        drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined
        message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the
        callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python,
        it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended
        way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the
        Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the
        same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback
        in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will
        have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.
        The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl,
        dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the
        other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
        '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

        The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.
        Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state
        of its parent layout(s).

        This flag is only used during queries. In MEL, if it appears before -query then
        it must be followed by the name of one of the scene's reference nodes. That will
        determine the reference to be queried by whatever flags appear after -query. If
        the named reference node does not exist within the scene the command will fail
        with an error. In Python the equivalent behavior is obtained by passing the name
        of the reference node as the flag's value. In MEL, if this flag appears after
        -query then it takes no argument and will cause the command to return the name
        of the reference node associated with the file given as the command's argument.
        If the file is not a reference or for some reason does not have a reference node
        (e.g., the user deleted it) then an empty string will be returned. If the file
        is not part of the current scene then the command will fail with an error. In
        Python the equivalent behavior is obtained by passing True as the flag's value.
        In query mode, this flag can accept a value.

    Use this command to remove and change the modifications which have been applied
    to references. A valid commandTarget is either a reference node, a reference
    file, a node in a reference, or a plug from a reference. Only modifications that
    have been made from the currently open scene can be changed or removed. The
    'referenceQuery -topReference' command can be used to determine what
    modifications have been made to a given commandTarget. Additionally only
    unapplied edits will be affected. Edits are unapplied when the node(s) which
    they affect are unloaded, or when they could not be successfully applied. By
    default this command only works on failed edits (this can be adjusted using the
    -failedEditsand -successfulEditsflags). Specifying a reference node as the
    command target is equivalent to specifying every node in the target reference
    file as a target. In this situation the results may differ depending on whether
    the target reference is loaded or unloaded. When it is unloaded, edits that
    affect both a node in the target reference and a node in one of its descendant
    references may be missed (e.g. those edits may not be removed). This is because
    when a reference is unloaded Maya no longer retains detailed information about
    which nodes belong to it. However, edits that only affect nodes in the target
    reference or in one of its ancestral references should be removed as expected.
    When the flags -removeEdits and -editCommand are used together, by default all
    connectAttr edits are removed from the specified source object. To remove only
    edits that connect to a specific target object, the target object can be passed
    as an additional argument to the command. This narrows the match criteria, so
    that only edits that connect the source object to the provided target in this
    additional argument are removed. See the example below. NOTE: When specifying a
    plug it is important to use the appropriate long attribute name.
    
    Flags:
    - applyFailedEdits : afe         (bool)          [create]
        Attempts to apply any unapplied edits. This flag is useful if previously failing
        edits have been fixed using the -changeEditTarget flag. This flag can only be
        used on loaded references. If the command target is a referenced node, the
        associated reference is used instead.
    
    - changeEditTarget : cet         (unicode, unicode) [create]
        Used to change a target of the specified edits. This flag takes two parameters:
        the old target of the edits, and the new target to change it to. The target can
        either be a node name (node), a node and attribute name (node.attr), or just an
        attribute name (.attr). If an edit currently affects the old target, it will be
        changed to affect the new target. Flag 'referenceQuery' should be used to
        determine the format of the edit targets. As an example most edits store the
        long name of the attribute (e.g. translateX), so when specifying the old target,
        a long name must also be used. If the short name is specified (e.g. tx), chances
        are the edit won't be retargeted.

        be included. This flag requires a string parameter. Valid values are: addAttr,
        connectAttr, deleteAttr, disconnectAttr, parent, setAttr, lockand unlock. In
        some contexts, this flag may be specified more than once to specify multiple
        edit types to consider.
    
    - failedEdits : fld              (bool)          [create]
        This is a secondary flag used to indicate whether or not failed edits should be
        acted on (e.g. queried, removed, etc...). A failed edit is an edit which could
        not be successfully applied the last time its reference was loaded. An edit can
        fail for a variety of reasons (e.g. the referenced node to which it applies was
        removed from the referenced file). By default failed edits will be acted on.
    
    - onReferenceNode : orn          (unicode)       [create,query]
        This is a secondary flag used to indicate that only those edits which are stored

        This is a secondary flag used to indicate whether or not successful edits should
        be acted on (e.g. queried, removed, etc...). A successful edit is any edit which
        was successfully applied the last time its reference was loaded. This flag will

        When using the -selected/-sel flag, if any of the selected nodes are referenced,
        also include/exclude any setAttr edits on those nodes. If used with the
        -onReferenceNode/-orn flag, include/exclude any setAttr edits on the reference.

    - selected : sel                 (bool)          [create,query]
        Export will operate on the list of nodes currently selected. This flag differs
        from the exportSelected flag in that the selected nodes are not exported, only
        the edits on them, and any nodes found via the include flags that are used (such

def namespaceInfo(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command displays information about a namespace. The target namespace can
    optionally be specified on the command line. If no namespace is specified, the
    command will display information about the current namespace. A namespace is a
    simple grouping of objects under a given name. Each item in a namespace can then
    be identified by its own name, along with what namespace it belongs to.
    Namespaces can contain other namespaces like sets, with the restriction that all
    namespaces are disjoint. Namespaces are primarily used to resolve name-clash
    issues in Maya, where a new object has the same name as an existing object (from
    importing a file, for example). Using namespaces, you can have two objects with
    the same name, as long as they are contained in different namespaces. Note that
    namespaces are a simple grouping of names, so they do not effect selection, the
    DAG, the Dependency Graph, or any other aspect of Maya.  All namespace names are
    colon-separated. The namespace format flags are: baseName(shortName), fullName
    and absoluteName. The flags are used in conjunction with the main query flags to
    specify the desired namespace format of the returned result. They can also be
    used to return the different formats of a specified namespace. By default, when
    no format is specified, the result will be returned as a full name.
    
    Modifications:
        - returns an empty list when the result is None
        - returns wrapped classes for listOnlyDependencyNodes
    
    Flags:
    - absoluteName : an              (bool)          [create]
        This is a general flag which can be used to specify the desired format for the
        namespace(s) returned by the command. The absolute name of the namespace is a
        full namespace path, starting from the root namespace :and including all parent
        namespaces.  For example :ns:ballis an absolute namespace name while ns:ballis
        not. The absolute namespace name is invariant and is not affected by the current
        namespace or relative namespace modes. See also other format modifiers
        'baseName', 'fullName', etc
    
    - baseName : bn                  (bool)          [create]
        This is a general flag which can be used to specify the desired format for the
        namespace(s) returned by the command. The base name of the namespace contains
        only the leaf level name and does not contain its parent namespace(s). For
        example the base name of an object named ns:ballis ball. This mode will always
        return the base name in the same manner, and is not affected by the current
        namespace or relative namespace mode. See also other format modifiers
        'absoluteName', 'fullName', etc The flag 'shortName' is a synonym for
        'baseName'.
    
    - currentNamespace : cur         (bool)          [create]
        Display the name of the current namespace.
    
    - dagPath : dp                   (bool)          [create]
        This flag modifies the 'listNamespace' and 'listOnlyDependencyNodes' flags to
        indicate that the names of any dag objects returned will include as much of the
        dag path as is necessary to make the names unique. If this flag is not present,
        the names returned will not include any dag paths.
    
    - fullName : fn                  (bool)          [create]
        This is a general flag which can be used to specify the desired format for the
        namespace(s) returned by the command. The full name of the namespace contains
        both the namespace path and the base name, but without the leading colon
        representing the root namespace. For example ns:ballis a full name, whereas
        :ns:ballis an absolute name. This mode is affected by the current namespace and
        relative namespace modes. See also other format modifiers 'baseName',
        'absoluteName', etc.
    
    - internal : int                 (bool)          [create]
        This flag is used together with the 'listOnlyDependencyNodes' flag. When this
        flag is set, the returned list will include internal nodes (for example
        itemFilters) that are not listed by default.
    
    - isRootNamespace : ir           (bool)          [create]
        Returns true if the namespace is root(:), false if not.
    
    - listNamespace : ls             (bool)          [create]
        List the contents of the namespace.
    
    - listOnlyDependencyNodes : lod  (bool)          [create]
        List all dependency nodes in the namespace.
    
    - listOnlyNamespaces : lon       (bool)          [create]
        List all namespaces in the namespace.
    
    - parent : p                     (bool)          [create]
        Display the parent of the namespace. By default, the list returned will not
        include internal nodes (such as itemFilters). To include the internal nodes, use
        the 'internal' flag.
    
    - recurse : r                    (bool)          [create]
        Can be specified with 'listNamespace', 'listOnlyNamespaces' or
        'listOnlyDependencyNode' to cause the listing to recursively include any child
        namespaces of the namespaces;
    
    - shortName : sn                 (bool)          [create]
        This flag is deprecated and may be removed in future releases of Maya. It is a
        synonym for the baseName flag. Please use the baseName flag instead.

    - i : lnr                        (bool)          [create]
        This flag is obsolete and has been replaced witht the loadReferenceDepth flag.
        When used with the -open flag, no references will be loaded. When used with
        -i/import, -r/reference or -lr/loadReference flags, will load the top-most
        reference only.
    
    - i : lrd                        (unicode)       [create]
        Used to specify which references should be loaded. Valid types are all, noneand
        topOnly, which will load all references, no references and top-level references
        only, respectively. May only be used with the -o/open, -i/import, -r/reference
        or -lr/loadReference flags. When noneis used with -lr/loadReference, only path
        validation is performed. This can be used to replace a reference without
        triggering reload. Not using loadReferenceDepth will load references in the same
        loaded or unloaded state that they were in when the file was saved.
        Additionally, the -lr/loadReference flag supports a fourth type, asPrefs. This
        will force any nested references to be loaded according to the state (if any)
        stored in the current scene file, rather than according to the state saved in
        the reference file itself.
    
    - i : dns                        (bool)          [create]
        Use the default name space for import and referencing.  This is an advanced
        option.  If set, then on import or reference, Maya will attempt to place all
        nodes from the imported or referenced file directly into the root (default) name
        space, without invoking any name clash resolution algorithms.  If the names of
        any of the new objects    already exist in the root namespace, then errors will
        result. The user of this flag is responsible for creating a name clash
        resolution mechanism outside of Maya to avoid such errors. Note:This flag    is
        intended only for use with custom file translators written through    the API.
        Use at your own risk.
    
    - i : dr                         (bool)          [create,query]
        When used in conjunction with the -reference flag, this flag determines if the
        reference is loaded, or if loading is deferred.C: The default is false.Q: When
        queried, this flag returns true if the reference is deferred, or false if the
        reference is not deferred. If this is used with -rfn/referenceNode, the -rfn
        flag must come before -q.
    
    - i : gr                         (bool)          [create]
        Used only with the -r or the -i flag. Used to group all the imported/referenced
        items under a single transform.
    
    - i : gn                         (unicode)       [create]
        Used only with the -gr flag. Optionally used to set the name of the transform
        node that the imported/referenced items will be grouped under.
    
    - i : ra                         (bool)          [create]
        If true, rename all newly-created nodes, not just those whose names clash with
        existing nodes. Only available with -i/import.
    
    - i : rpr                        (unicode)       [create,query]
        The string to use as a prefix for all objects from this file. This flag has been
        replaced by -ns/namespace.
    
    - i : sns                        (unicode, unicode) [create]
        Can only be used in conjunction with the -r/reference or -i/import flags. This
        flag will replace any occurrences of a given namespace to an alternate specified
        namespace. This namespace swapwill occur as the file is referenced in. It takes
        in two string arguments. The first argument specifies the namespace to replace.
        The second argument specifies the replacement namespace. Use of this flag,
        implicitly enables the use of namespaces and cannot be used with deferReference.
    
    - i : rnn                        (bool)          [create]
        Used to control the return value in open, import, loadReference, and reference
        operations. It will force the file command to return a list of new nodes added
        to the current scene.
    
    - i : pr                         (bool)          [create]
        Modifies the various import/export flags such that references are
        imported/exported as actual references rather than copies of those references.
