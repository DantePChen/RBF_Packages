# 
# DESCRIPTION:
# 
# Produces the MEL command "marqueeToolContext".
# 
# This plug-in demonstrates "marquee selection" in a user defined context.
# It is supported in Viewport 2.0 and OpenGL.  Selection is done through 
# the API (MGlobal).
# 
########################################################################
# First make sure that marqueeTool.py is in your MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH.  Then, 
# to use the tool, execute the following in the script editor:
#
# from maya import cmds
# cmds.loadPlugin("marqueeTool.py")
# ctx = cmds.marqueeToolContext()
# cmds.setToolTo(ctx)
# 
# Once the tool is active, you can select objects in the 3D windows in the 
# same way that you do with the selection tool (it can be used for either 
# click selection or drag selection). Both will also work with the shift 
# key held down in the same manner as the selection tool.
