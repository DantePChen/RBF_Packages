"""
Helper class that maintains the deformer evaluator mode information.
Manages the deformer evaluator-specific data, the common data is
managed by the base class.

The object is set up to use the Python "with" syntax as follows:

    from maya.debug.DeformerEvaluatorManager import DeformerEvaluatorManager
    with DeformerEvaluatorManager() as mgr:
        mgr.setMode( someMode )

That will ensure the original states are all restored. There's no other
reliable way to do it in Python. If you need different syntax you can
manually call the method to complete the sequence:

    mgr = DeformerEvaluatorManager()
    mgr.save_state()
    mgr.setMode( someMode )
    mgr.restore_state()
