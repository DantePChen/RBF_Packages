"""
This factory creates Qt proxy items from render setup data model nodes.
It provides an extensible mechanism to create Qt proxy items for various
render setup data model types.

To create a Qt proxy item for a data model class, a creator callable is
registered on the data model class type.  On creation, the creator
callable is given the data model node.  It must return an instance of a
class derived from ModelProxyItem.

The proxy factory is a singleton.
