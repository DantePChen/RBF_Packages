"""
This module provides the drag and drop base and concrete classes.

They are derived from the API class MPxDragAndDropBehavior and are
used to handle the connections to make when the user drops a node 
or an attribute on to another node or attribute.

The interface to implement for each derived class is the following:

    - shouldBeUsedFor(sourceNode, destinationNode, sourcePlug, destinationPlug) -> bool
        # Returns True if the class should be used for this connection

    - connectAttrToAttr(sourcePlug, destinationPlug, force) -> None
        # Create all connections needed when sourcePlug is dropped on destinationPlug

    - connectAttrToNode(sourcePlug, destinationNode, force) -> None
        # Create all connections needed when sourcePlug is dropped on destinationNode

    - connectNodeToAttr(sourceNode, destinationPlug, force) -> None
        # Create all connections needed when sourceNode is dropped on destinationPlug

    - connectNodeToNode(sourceNode, destinationNode, force) -> None
        # Create all connections needed when sourceNode is dropped on destinationNode
