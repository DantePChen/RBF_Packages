"""
The overridden attribute manager is a singleton that observes the scene to
react to attribute changes.  If the attribute change is on an attribute
that is overridden by render setup, the attribute manager will attempt to
take the value change and reproduce it on the override itself.

This allows for convenient workflows like using direct manipulation on an
object with a value override, where the value is actually written back to
the override.

Apply value override nodes conditionally implement the passive output plug
behavior, through a chain of responsibility.  A passive output allows
setting its destination input.  If this destination input is connected to
an apply override node, the overridden attribute manager asks the
highest-priority apply override node to write the value to its
corresponding override, if it's enabled, else pass the request to the next
lower-priority apply override node.  The chain ends by writing into the
original.  If the highest-priority apply override node returns true from
isPassiveOutput(), this means that the overridden attribute write must
succeed, as one of the apply override nodes in the chain will accept the
write.

Autokey functionality is supported in this framework: in autokey mode, we
query the auto keyer to ask if an overridden attribute would be auto-keyed.
If so, we add the override attribute to the list of attributes the auto
keyer will add keys to.  See the autoKey render setup module and the
autoKeyframe command for more information.

Note that it is understood that changing the override value will cause all
overridden attributes to change.
