        If this attribute is FALSE, the default, then the attenuation makes the field's
        effect decrease as the affected point is further from the volume's axis and
        closer to its edge.  If the is set to TRUE, then the effect of the field

    - position : pos                 (float, float, float) [query,edit]
        Position in space (x,y,z) where you want to place a gravity field. The gravity

        space.
    
    - volumeShape : vsh              (unicode)       [query,edit]
        Volume shape of the field.  Sets/edits/queries the field's volume shape
        attribute.  If set to any value other than none, determines a 3-D volume within
        which the field has effect. Values are: none,cube,sphere,cylinder,cone,torus.
    
    - volumeSweep : vsw              (float)         [query,edit]

    necessary connections.  If any of the attributes already exist, the command
    simply connects to them.  The command also toggles any relevant attributes in
    the emitter or field to indicate that per-point capability is being used. The
    command adds a separate per-point attribute to the owning object for each
    emitter/field.  For example, for emission rate, there is a separate ratePP for
    each emitter.  These attributes are named according to the convention
    emitter/field nameattr namePP.  For example, if a particle shape owned an
    emitter smoke, that shape would get attribute smokeRatePP.The name of the object
    must be the emitter or field for which per-point capability is to be added (or
    the name of its parent transform).  The addPP command adds the per-point
    capability for that emitter or field but not for any others owned by the same

    example, it would add per-point rate for all selected emitters.) If addPP
    detects that the owner object has left-over attributes from a deleted emitter,
    it will remove those attributes before adding the new ones.  Thus, you can
    delete the emitter, make a new one, and run addPP again, and addPP will clean up
    after the deleted emitter.  This is most commonly used if you have a geometry
    emitter and then decide to change the geometry.  Likewise, if addPP detects that
    some cvs or vertices have been added to the geometry, then it will expand the
    corresponding multi-attributes as necessary.  However, if it detects that some

    - inheritRotation : iro          (bool)          [query,edit]
        If this is set to 'true', then the direction vector described with -dx, -dy, and
        -dz will be considered local to the owning object. Therefore, if the owning
        object's transform undergoes any rotation (by itself or one of its parents), the
        direction vector of the air field will undergo that same rotation.
    
    - inheritVelocity : iv           (float)         [query,edit]
        Amount (from 0 to 1) of the field-owner's velocity added to the vector
        determined by the direction and speed flags. The combination of these two
        vectors makes up the TOTAL velocity vector for the air field. This allows the
        air to be determined directly by the motion of the owning object.
    
    - magnitude : m                  (float)         [query,edit]
        Strength of field.
    
    - maxDistance : mxd              (float)         [query,edit]
        Maximum distance at which field is exerted. -1 indicates that the field has no
        maximum distance.
    
    - name : n                       (unicode)       [query,edit]
        name of field
    
    - perVertex : pv                 (bool)          [query,edit]
        Per-vertex application. If this flag is set true, then each individual point
        (CV, particle, vertex,etc.) of the chosen object exerts an identical copy of the
        force field. If this flag is set to false, then the froce is exerted only from
        the geometric center of the set of points.
    
    - position : pos                 (float, float, float) [query,edit]
        Position in space (x,y,z) where you want to place a gravity field. The gravity
        then emanates from this position in space rather than from an object. Note that
        you can both use -pos (creating a field at a position) and also provide object
        names.
    
    - speed : s                      (float)         [query,edit]
        How fast the affected objects' speed reaches the speed (based on the -mag, -dx,
        -dy, -dz flags) of the air field. This value gets clamped internally to be
        between 0.0 and 1.0.  A value of 0.0 will make the air field have no effect. A
        value of 1.0 will try to match the air field's speed much quicker, but not
        necessarily immediately.
    
    - spread : sp                    (float)         [query,edit]
        This represents the angle from the direction vector within which objects will be
        affected. The values are in the range of 0 to 1. A value of 0 will result in an
        effect only exactly in front of the air field along the direction vector. A
        value of 1 will result in any object in front of the owning object, 90 degrees
        in all direction from the direction vector.
    
    - torusSectionRadius : tsr       (float)         [query,edit]
        Section radius for a torus volume.  Applies only to torus. Similar to the
        section radius in the torus modelling primitive.
    
    - velocityComponentOnly : vco    (bool)          [query,edit]
        If this is 'false', the air will accelerate or decelerate the affected objects
        so that their velocities will eventually match the TOTAL velocity vector of the
        air field. If this is 'true', only ACCELERTION is applied to the affected
        objects so that their velocity component along the TOTAL velocity vector matches
        or is greater in magnitude than the TOTAL velocity vector. This will not slow
        objects down to match velocities, only speed them up to match components. This
        is most useful when using the -iv flag with a value 0.
    
    - volumeExclusion : vex          (bool)          [query,edit]
        Volume exclusion of the field.  If true, points outside the volume (defined by
        the volume shape attribute) are affected,  If false, points inside the volume
        are affected.  Has no effect if volumeShape is set to none.
    
    - volumeOffset : vof             (float, float, float) [query,edit]
        Volume offset of the field.  Volume offset translates the field's volume by the
        specified amount from the actual field location. This is in the field's local
        space.
    
    - volumeShape : vsh              (unicode)       [query,edit]
        Volume shape of the field.  Sets/edits/queries the field's volume shape
        attribute.  If set to any value other than none, determines a 3-D volume within
        which the field has effect. Values are: none,cube,sphere,cylinder,cone,torus.
    
    - volumeSweep : vsw              (float)         [query,edit]
        Volume sweep of the field.  Applies only to sphere, cone, cylinder, and torus.
        Similar effect to the sweep attribute in modelling.
    
    - wakeSetup : wks                (bool)          [edit]
        Like the 'windSetup' and 'fanSetup', 'wakeSetup' sets certain values in the
        field to approximate the movement of air near a moving object, such as  a
        character's foot or hand. The values that are set are: inheritVelocity 1.0
        inheritRotation false componentOnly true enableSpread false speed 0.0
    
    - windSetup : wns                (bool)          [edit]
        This will set some of the values above in a way that approximates the effects of
        a basic wind. This allows the user to then change certain values as he/she
        wishes on the same command line. First the preset values get set, and then any
        other flags that were passed get taken into account. These are the values that
        get set to approximate 'wind': inheritVelocity 0.0 inheritRotation true

    The spring command can do any of the following:\* create a new spring object
    (shape plus transform).  The shape contains springs between the points
    (particles, cvs, etc.) of the objects selected or listed on the command line.\*
    create new springs and add them to an existing spring object\* edit or query
    certain attributes of an existing spring objectOne spring objectmay have
    hundreds or even thousands of individual springs. Certain attributes of the
    spring object specify exactly where the springs are attached to which other
    objects.Springs may be attached to the following: particles, vertices of soft
    bodies, CVs or edit points of curves or surfaces, vertices of polygonal objects,
    and points of lattices. In the case where one endpoint of a spring is non-
    dynamic (a CV, edit point, etc.), the spring does not affect its motion, but the
    motion of the point affects the spring. A spring will be created only if at
    least one of the endpoints is dynamic: for example, a spring will never be
    created between two CVs. A single spring object can hold springs which are
    incident to any number of other objects.The spring has creation-only flags and
    editable flags.  Creation-only flags (minDistance, maxDistance, add, exclusive,
    all, wireframe, walklength, checkExisting) can be used only when creating new
    springs (including adding springs to existing spring object).  Editable flags
    modify attributes of an existing spring object.If a spring object is created,
    this command returns the names of the shape and transform.  If a spring object
    is queried, the command returns the results of the query.
    
    Flags:
    - addSprings : add               (bool)          [create]
        If specified, springs will be added to the existing selected set of springs.

    - allPoints : all                (bool)          [create,edit]
        If True, sets the mode of spring application to All.  This will add springs

        Return the number of springs in the shape.  Query-only. We maintain this flag
        only for compatibility with earlier versions of Maya.  To get the count of

        Damping factor for the springs created in the spring object. This will
        initialize all the entries in dampingPS to the specified value. In both the flag
        and the attribute name, PSstands for per-spring.(Default = 0.2 )
    
    - endForceWeight : efw           (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Amount of the force of the spring that gets applied to the point to which the
        spring ends. Valid range is from 0.0 to 1.0. (Default = 1.0 )
    
    - exclusive : exc                (bool)          [create]
        If true, tells the command to create springs only between pairs of points which
        are not in the same object. (Default is False.)
    
    - length : l                     (float)         [create,query,edit]

        minimum and maximum distance values set with min and max. (Default is False.)
        Note: This gets automatically set if either the min or max flags are used.

        length will be initialized to the distance between the two  points at the time
        the spring is created (i.e., the initial length of the spring).   When playing
        back, springs can use either their per-spring or per-object rest length.  See
        the -rl and -urp flags. In both the flag and the attribute name, PSstands for
        per-spring.
    
    - startForceWeight : sfw         (float)         [create,query,edit]

    - stiffnessPS : sPS              (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Stiffness of the springs created in the spring object. This will initialize all
        the entries in stiffnessPS to the specified value. In both the flag and the
        attribute name, PSstands for per-spring.(Default = 1.0 )

    - useDampingPS : udp             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        Specifies whether to use dampingPS (per spring damping). If set to false, the
        per object damping attribute value will be used. This flag simply sets the
        useDampingPS attribute of the spring shape. In both the flag and the attribute
        name, PSstands for per-spring.(Default = false )
    
    - useRestLengthPS : urp          (bool)          [create,query,edit]

        useStiffnessPS attribute of the spring shape. In both the flag and the attribute
        name, PSstands for per-spring.(Default = false )
    
    - walkLength : wl                (int)           [create]
        This flag is valid only when doing wireframe creation. It will create springs
        between pairs of points connected by the specified number of edges.  For
        example, if walk length is 2, each pair of points separated by no more than 2
        edges will get a spring.  Walk length measures the distance between pairs of
        vertices just like the number of blocks measures the distance between two
        intersections in a city.
    
    - wireframe : wf                 (bool)          [create]
        If True, sets the mode of the spring application to Wireframe. This is valid
        only for springs created on a soft body. It will add springs along all edges
        connecting the adjacent points (vertices or CV's) of curves and surfaces.
        (Default is False.)                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed
        either as a tuple or a list.
