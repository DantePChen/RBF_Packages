    This analytic collects the types of nodes before and after a unit conversion node.
    
    The output consists of a dictionary entry with a before and after section.
    The 'before' section contains node type/count pairs indicating how many times
    they appear before a unit conversion node. The 'after' section contains node
    type/count pairs indicating how many times they appear after a unit conversion
    node. ('Before' and 'after' refer to upstream and downstream connections
    respectively.) The 'conversion' section contains counts of the unit conversion
    nodes that use various conversion factors.
