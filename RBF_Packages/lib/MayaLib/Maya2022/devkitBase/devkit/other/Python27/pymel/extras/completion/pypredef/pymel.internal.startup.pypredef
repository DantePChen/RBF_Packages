    Try to init Maya standalone module, use when running pymel from an external Python inerpreter,
    it is possible to pass the desired Maya version number to define which Maya to initialize
    
    
    Part of the complexity of initializing maya in standalone mode is that maya does not populate os.environ when
    parsing Maya.env.  If we initialize normally, the env's are available via maya (via the shell), but not in python
    via os.environ.
    
    Note: the following example assumes that MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH is not set in your shell environment prior to launching
    python or mayapy.
    
    >>> import maya.standalone            #doctest: +SKIP
    >>> maya.standalone.initialize()      #doctest: +SKIP
    >>> import maya.mel as mm             #doctest: +SKIP
    >>> print mm.eval("getenv MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH")    #doctest: +SKIP
    /Network/Servers/sv-user.luma-pictures.com/luma .....
    >>> import os                         #doctest: +SKIP
    >>> 'MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH' in os.environ  #doctest: +SKIP
    False
    
    The solution lies in `refreshEnviron`, which copies the environment from the shell to os.environ after maya.standalone
    initializes.
