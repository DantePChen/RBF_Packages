    - nodeState : nds                (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would
        not be animated.  Default:kdnNormal
    
    - worldSpace : ws                (bool)          [create,query,edit]

        taken in world reference. If off: all geometrical values are taken in object

        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in

        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),

        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would
        not be animated.  Default:kdnNormal

        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as

        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to

        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is

    - nodeState : nds                (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would

        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to

        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is

        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in

    - nodeState : nds                (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would

        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child

    - nodeState : nds                (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would
        not be animated.  Default:kdnNormal

    - keepFaceGroupBorder : kfb      (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        If true, reduction will try to retain borders of face groups, which are mostly
        used to define material assignments.  This flag only applies when using the new

        If keepFaceGroupBorder is on, this flag specifies the weight to assign to
        material borders.  Setting this value to 0 will disable group border

        This flag only applies when using the old algorithm and is provided for
        backwards compatibility. If true, vertices will try to retain their original

    - keepQuadsWeight : kqw          (float)         [create,query,edit]
        This flag controls how much consideration is given to oreserving quad faces
        during reduction.  A higher weight means the reduction will try harder to keep
        quad faces and avoid creation of triangles. If the version flag is set to 1
        (-version 1) and the keepQuadsWeight flag is set to 1.0 then a special quad
        reduction algorithm is used that does a better job of preserving quads. Howver,
        this special quad reduction algorithm does not support symmetry so those flags
        will be ignored when the keepQuadsWeight flag is set to 1.0. C: Default is 0. Q:
        When queried, this flag returns a float.

    - nodeState : nds                (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would
        not be animated.  Default:kdnNormal
    
    - percentage : p                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
        This flag specifies how many vertices to remove during reduction as a percentage
        of the original mesh.  This flag only applies if the termination flag is set to
        0 or when using the old algorithm. C: Default is 0. 100 will remove every
        possible vertex, 0 will remove none. Q: When queried, this flag returns a float.
    
    - preserveLocation : pl          (bool)          [create]
        This flag guarantees that if the original geometry is preserved, the new

    - preserveTopology : top         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        this flag guarantees that the topological type will be preserved during
        reduction.  In particular, if the input is manifold then the output will be
        manifold.  This option also prevents holes in the mesh from being closed off.
        This flag only applies when using the new algorithm. (-version 1) C: Default is
        true. Q: When queried, this flag returns a boolean.
    
    - replaceOriginal : rpo          (bool)          [create]
        Create in place(i.e., replace) (not available in all commands). NOTE: This flag
        is intended for use by the Reducemenu item. If 'polyReduce -rpo 0' is executed
        from the command line, Shader information will not be copied from the original
        mesh to the result.
    
    - sharpness : shp                (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Sharpness controls the balance between preserving small, sharp details versus
        larger shapes.  At low values, details that are small relative to the general
        shape of the object are more likely to be collapsed.  At high values, they are
        more likely to be kept.  This flag only applies when using the new algorithm.

    - symmetryPlaneZ : sz            (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Z value of the symmetry plane.  This flag only applies when using the new

        is 0. Q: When queried, this flag returns a float.
    
    - symmetryTolerance : stl        (float)         [create,query,edit]
        Tolerance to use when applying symmetry. For each vertex of the mesh, we find
        its exact symmetric point, then we look for the closest vertex to the exact
        symmetry up to the tolerance distance.  Higher values risk finding more spurious
        symmetries, lower values might miss symmetries. The value is distance in object
        space.  This flag only applies when using the new algorithm (-version 1) and the
        useVirtualSymmetry flag is not set to 0. C: Default is 0. Q: When queried, this
        flag returns a float.
    
    - termination : trm              (int)           [create,query,edit]

        integer.
    
    - triangleCount : tct            (int)           [create,query,edit]
        This flag specifies a target number of triangles to retain after reduction. Note
        that other factors such as quad and feature preservation may take precendence
        and cause the actual number of triangles to be different. This flag only applies
        when using the new algorithm (-version 1) and the termination flag is set to 2.
        C: Default is 0. Q: When queried, this flag returns an integer.
    
    - triangulate : t                (bool)          [create,query,edit]
        This flag only applies when using the old algorithm and is provided for
        backwards compatibility. This attribute specifies if the geometry or the
        selected faces has to be triangulated, before performing reduction. C: Default
        is true. Q: When queried, this flag returns a boolean.
    
    - useVirtualSymmetry : uvs       (int)           [create,query,edit]
        This flag controls whether symmetry is preserved during the reduction. This flag
        only applies when using the new algorithm (-version 1) and the keepQuadsWeight
        flag is less than 1.0. 0 No symmetry preservation 1 Automatic. Try to find
        suitable symmetry during reduction. 2 Plane.  Specify a symmetry plane to use

    - uvWeights : uwt                (float)         [create,query,edit]
        This flag only applies when using the old algorithm and is provided for
        backwards compatibility. How much consideration uv positions are given in the
        reduction algorithm. A higher weight means the reduction will try harder to
        preserve uv positions. C: Default is 0. Q: When queried, this flag returns a
        float.
    
    - version : ver                  (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Version of the poly reduce algorithm to use. 0 Old algorithm used in Maya 2013
        and prior for backwards compatibility 1 New algorithm derived from Softimage and
        used in Maya 2014 and later The default is 0 for backwards compatibility but for
        best results it is recommended that the new algorithm is used as it is better at
        preserving mesh details. Some flags only apply to a specific algorithm and this
        is documented for each flag. C: Default is 0 for backwards compatibility. Q:
        When queried, this flag returns an integer.
    
    - vertexCount : vct              (int)           [create,query,edit]
        This flag specifies a target number of vertices to retain after reduction. Note
        that other factors such as quad and feature preservation may take precendence
        and cause the actual number of vertices to be different. This flag only applies
        when using the new algorithm (-version 1) and the termination flag is set to 1.
        C: Default is 0. Q: When queried, this flag returns an integer.
    
    - vertexMapName : vmp            (unicode)       [create,query]
        Name of a color set to be added to the output mesh that stores a mapping from
        vertices in the output mesh to vertices in the input mesh.  The color set is
        RGB.  The original vertex Id that maps to an output vertex is of a vertex is
        65536\*r + g where r and g are the red and green channel at a vertex. The blue
        channel is always zero.  Each vertex in the output mesh has a shared color. This
        flag only applies when using the new algorithm. (-version 1) Q: When queried,
        this flag returns a string.
    
    - vertexWeightCoefficient : vwc  (float)         [create,query,edit]
        This flag specifies a constant value to multiply to each weight map value. A
        value of zero turns off the weight map.  This flag only applies when using the
        new algorithm. (-version 1) C: Default is 1. Q: When queried, this flag returns
        a float.
    
    - weightCoefficient : wc         (float)         [create,query,edit]
        This flag only applies when using the old algorithm and is provided for
        backwards compatibility. The weight of each vertex is multiplied with this
        coefficient when the reduction is performed.  This value does not have to be
        edited, normally.  It gives finer control over the weighted reduction. This
        attribute is replaced by vertexWeightCoefficient in the new algorithm when the
        version flag is set to 1. C: Default is 10000. Q: When queried, this flag
        returns a float.                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed
        either as a tuple or a list.

def offsetCurve(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The offset command creates new offset curves from the selected curves. The
    connecting type for breaks in offsets is off (no connection), circular (connect
    with an arc) or linear (connect linearly resulting in a sharp corner). If loop
    cutting is on then any loops in the offset curves are trimmed away. For the
    default cut radius of 0.0 a sharp corner is created at each intersection. For
    values greater than 0.0 a small arc of that radius is created at each
    intersection. The cut radius value is only valid when loop cutting is on.
    Offsets (for planar curves) are calculated in the plane of that curve and 3d
    curves are offset in 3d. The subdivisionDensity flag is the maximum number of
    times the offset object can be subdivided (i.e. calculate the offset until the
    offset comes within tolerance or the iteration reaches this maximum.) The
    reparameterize option allows the offset curve to have a different
    parameterization to the original curve. This avoids uneven parameter
    distributions in the offset curve that can occur with large offsets of curves,
    but is more expensive to compute.

        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in

        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would
        not be animated.  Default:kdnNormal

def editMetadata(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command is used to set metadata elements onto or remove metadata elements
    from an object. Before using this command you must first attach a metadata
    stream type to the object using the addMetadatacommand or an API equivalent. The
    command has four basic variations: Set per-component metadata on meshesRemove
    per-component metadata on meshesSet generic metadata on any objectRemove generic
    metadata on any objectThe difference between the setand removevariations (1,3
    vs. 2,4) is that setrequires both a member name to be set and a new value to be
    set. (The reason removal doesn't use a member name is that you can only remove
    an entire metadata structural element, you cannot remove only a single member
    from it.)  When metadata values are set or removed the action is performed on
    every selected component or index. This provides an easy method to set or remove
    a bunch of metadata en masse.  The general usage (variations 3, 4) lets you
    select specific pieces of metadata through the channelNameand indexflags. Note
    that since indexis a multi-use flag you can select many different elements from
    the same Channel and set or remove the metadata on all of them in one command.
    Metadata on meshes is special in that the Channel types vertex, edge, face, and
    vertexFaceare directly connected to the components of the same name. To make
    setting these metadata Channels easier you can simply select or specify on the
    command line the corresponding components rather than using the channelNameand
    indexflags. For example the selection myMesh.vtx[8:10]corresponds to channelName
    = vertexand index = 8, 9, 10(as a multi-use flag).  Note that the metadata is
    assigned to an object and except in the special case of mesh geometry does not
    flow through the dependency graph. In meshes the metadata will move from node to
    node wherever the geometry is connected, although it will not adjust itself
    automatically for changes in topology. Internal data is arranged to minimize the
    amount of copying no matter how many other nodes are connected to it.  Only a
    single node or scene, component type, channel type, and value type are allowed
    in a single command. This keeps the data simple at the possible cost of
    requiring multiple calls to the command to set more than one structure member's
    value.  Certain nodes have metadata supplied by input attributes. If you edit
    one of those with an incoming connection on such an attribute then the metadata
    edit will not be applied directly it will be put into an 'editMetadata' node for
    application during DG evaluation. Since the details of the metadata are not
    known until the evaluation happens less rigorous compatibility checking is
    performed. The editMetadata node has its own facilities for verifying and
    reporting illegal metadata edits. Successive edits to the same metadata in this
    way appends each edit to the same editMetadata node.
    
    Flags:
    - channelName : cn               (unicode)       [create,query]
        Filter the metadata selection to only recognize metadata belonging to the
        specified named Channel (e.g. vertex). This flag is ignored if the components on
        the selection list are being used to specify the metadata of interest. In query
        mode, this flag can accept a value.
    
    - channelType : cht              (unicode)       [create,query]
        Obsolete - use the 'channelName' flag instead. In query mode, this flag can
        accept a value.
    
    - endIndex : eix                 (unicode)       [create]
        The metadata is stored in a Stream, which is an indexed list. If you have mesh
        components selected then the metadata indices are implicit in the list of
        selected components. If you select only the node or scene then this flag may be
        used in conjunction with the startIndexflag to specify a range of indices from
        which to retrieve the metadata. It is an error to have the value of startIndexbe
        greater than that of endIndex.  See also the indexflag for an alternate way to
        specify multiple indices. This flag can only be used on index types that support
        a range (e.g. integer values - it makes no sense to request a range between two
        strings)  In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
    
    - index : idx                    (unicode)       [create,query]
        In the typical case metadata is indexed using a simple integer value. Certain
        types of data may use other index types. e.g. a vertexFacecomponent will use a
        pairindex type, which is two integer values; one for the face ID of the
        component and the second for the vertex ID.  The indexflag takes a string,
        formatted in the way the specified indexTyperequires. All uses of the indexflag
        have the same indexType. If the type was not specified it is assumed to be a
        simple integer value.  In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
    
    - indexType : idt                (unicode)       [create,query]
        Name of the index type the new Channel should be using. If not specified this
        defaults to a simple integer index. Of the native types only a mesh
        vertexFacechannel is different, using a pairindex type. In query mode, this flag
        can accept a value.
    
    - memberName : mn                (unicode)       [create]
        Name of the Structure member being edited. The names of the members are set up
        in the Structure definition, either through the description passed in through
        the dataStructurecommand or via the API used to create that Structure.
    
    - remove : rem                   (bool)          [create]
        If the removeflag is set then the metadata will be removed rather than have
        values set. In this mode the memberName, value, and stringValueflags are
        ignored. memberNameis ignored because when deleting metadata all members of a
        structure must be removed as a group. The others are ignored since when deleting
        you don't need a value to be set.
    
    - scene : scn                    (bool)          [create,query]
        Use this flag when you want to add metadata to the scene as a whole rather than
        to any individual nodes. If you use this flag and have nodes selected the nodes
        will be ignored and a warning will be displayed.
    
    - startIndex : six               (unicode)       [create]
        The metadata is stored in a Stream, which is an indexed list. If you have mesh
        components selected then the metadata indices are implicit in the list of
        selected components. If you select only the node or scene then this flag may be
        used in conjunction with the endIndexflag to specify a range of indices from
        which to retrieve the metadata. It is an error to have the value of startIndexbe
        greater than that of endIndex.  See also the indexflag for an alternate way to
        specify multiple indices. This flag can only be used on index types that support
        a range (e.g. integer values - it makes no sense to request a range between two
        strings)  In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
    
    - streamName : stn               (unicode)       [create,query]
        Name of the metadata Stream. Depending on context it could be the name of a
        Stream to be created, or the name of the Stream to pass through the filter. In
        query mode, this flag can accept a value.Flag can have multiple arguments,
        passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
    - stringValue : sv               (unicode)       [create]
        String value to be set into the specified metadata locations. This flag can only
        be used when the data member is a numeric type. If the member has N dimensions
        (e.g. string[2]) then this flag must appear N times (e.g. 2 times) The same
        values are applied to the specified metadata member on all affected components
        or metadata indices. Only one of the value, and stringValue flags can be
        specified at once and the type must match the type of the structure member named
        by the memberflag.
    
    - value : v                      (float)         [create]
        Numeric value to be set into the specified metadata locations. This flag can
        only be used when the data member is a numeric type. If the member has N
        dimensions (e.g. float[3]) then this flag must appear N times (e.g. 3 times) The
        same values are applied to the specified metadata member on all affected
        components or metadata indices. All numeric member types should use this type of
        value specification, i.e. everything except string and matrix types. Only one of
        the value, and stringValue flags can be specified at once and the type must
        match the type of the structure member named by the memberflag.

    - nodeState : nds                (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would
        not be animated.  Default:kdnNormal

        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),

        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in

        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the

        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would
        not be animated.  Default:kdnNormal

    - nodeState : nds                (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock

        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would

    - nodeState : nds                (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %

        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def

    The insertKnotCurve command inserts knots into a curve given a list of parameter
    values. The number of knots to add at each parameter value and whether the knots
    are added or complemented can be specified. The name of the curve is returned.
    If construction history is on, the name of the resulting dependency node is also
    returned. An edit point will appear where you insert the knot. Also, the number
    of spans and CVs in the curve will increase in the area where the knot is
    inserted. You can insert up to degreeknots at a curve parameter that isn't
    already an edit point. eg. for a degree three curve, you can insert up to 3
    knots. Use this operation if you need more CVs in a local area of the curve. Use
    this operation (or hardenPoint) if you want to create a corner in a curve.

        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock

        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %

    The curve align command is used to align curves in maya. The main alignment
    options are positional, tangent and curvature continuity. Curvature continuity
    implies tangent continuity. Positional continuity means the curves (move) or the
    ends of the curves (modify) are changed. Tangent continuity means one of the
    curves is modified to be tangent at the points where they meet. Curvature
    continuity means one of the curves is modified to be curvature continuous as
    well as tangent. The default behaviour, when no curves or flags are passed, is
    to only do positional and tangent continuity on the active list with the end of
    the first curve and the start of the other curve used for alignment.

        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock

        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %

        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),

        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock

        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would

        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def

        UV mappings (e.g. the left hand side of the character on one side of the UV map,
        the right hand side on the other).
    
    - frontOfChain : foc             (bool)          [create,edit]
        This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed
        ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but
        not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the
        upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this
        flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset
        (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and
        edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
    
    - geometry : g                   (unicode)       [query,edit]

        deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag
        returns string string string ...
    
    - geometryIndices : gi           (bool)          [query]

        Default is false.
    
    - matchChoice : mch              (int)           [create,edit]
        When using topological component matching, selects between possible matches. If
        the meshes involved in the transfer operation have symmetries in their
        topologies, there may be more than one possible topological match. Maya scores
        the possible matches (by comparing the shapes of the meshes) and assigns them an
        index, starting at zero. Match zero, the default, is considered the best, but in
        the event that Maya chooses the wrong one, changing this value will allow the
        user to explore the other matches.

        Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending
        the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if

    - nodeState : nds                (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would
        not be animated.  Default:kdnNormal

        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would
        not be animated.  Default:kdnNormal                  Flag can have multiple
        arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in

        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would

    - tolerance : tol                (float)         [query,edit]

        curves end-to-end, the ends must be within tolerance for an intersection to be

        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %

        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current

        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is

        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock
        += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in
        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would
        not be animated.  Default:kdnNormal                  Flag can have multiple
        arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    - nodeState : nds                (int)           [create,query,edit]
        Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1),
        and Blocking (2)states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.   The
        Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5)are for
        internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during
        interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation
        is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blockingwill reset
        back to Blocking.   The Normaland Blockingcases apply to all nodes, while
        HasNoEffectis node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins
        store state in the MPxNode::stateattribute. Anyone can set it or check this
        attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.
        StateDescriptionNormalThe normal node state. This is the default.HasNoEffectThe
        HasNoEffectoption (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an
        operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all
        deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is
        not supported by all nodes.  Its typical to implement support for the
        HasNoEffectstate in the nodes compute method and to perform appropriate
        operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.  The usual implementation of
        this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying
        the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input
        geometry undeformed on the output.  BlockingThis is implemented in the depend
        node base class and applies to all nodes. Blockingis applied during the
        evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection
        will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current
        value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked
        connections are never cleaned.  When a node is set to Blockingthe behavior is
        supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as
        nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it wont evaluate after
        that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttrrequests but a
        getAttron a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.  Setting the
        root transform of a hierarchy to Blockingwont automatically influence child
        transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, youd need to explicitly set all child
        nodes to the Blockingstate.  For example, to set all child transforms to
        Blocking, you could use the following script.  import maya.cmds as cmds def
        blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in
        cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock

        {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' %
        node, 2 )  Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would
