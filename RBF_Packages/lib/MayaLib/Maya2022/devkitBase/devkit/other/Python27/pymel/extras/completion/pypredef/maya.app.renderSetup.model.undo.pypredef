This module provides a context manager that provides for convenient undo
macro commands (called "chunks" in Maya terminology).  It ensures that
only the top-level call to the undo context manager will open and close

class NotifyDecorateMgr:
    """
    Safe way to manage group pre/post calls operations around a command 
    using the 'with' statement.
    The NotifyDecorateMgr takes three arguments:
        - name: name of the undo chunk.
        - pre : a callable will always be executed before the command. 
        - post: a callable will always be executed after the command. 
        
    # IMPORTANT: 'pre' is always called first and 'post' is always called last,
    # no matter if the wrapped command is being done, undone or redone.
    
    The 'pre' and 'post' callables take one argument: a state pointer.
    The state has only two functions:
     - set(value) : store 'value' in the state object.
     - release() : clears the state object and return the stored value.
    
    This allows one to perform some checks before a command is performed, 
    store it temporarily and get it back after the command was performed.
    
    Example:
        def before(state):
            state.set(getMyState())
        
        def after(state):
            previous = state.release()
