    Plug class that handles dynamic plug and missing dependencies.

    Finalization creates a dynamic attribute based on another plug. It has 3 available modes:
     - kModeClone clones the input plug
     - kModeMultiply will have the same arity as the input plug but has float scalar units
       (can be used to multiply input's plug type by a scalar)
     - kModeOffset clones the input plug but with more flexible min/max, softMin/softMax
       (can be used to offset input's plug type by some value in the same units)
       
    Encode/decode creates/read dictionary of attributes that defines the plug attributes.
    
    Handles missing dependency:
     If the plug is decoded and can't find the source plug it's supposed to connect to, then
     it has a missing dependency. It creates a dynamic string attribute containing the name of the
     missing dependency (this allows the "missing dependency" state to persist on file new) and it 
     starts listening to scene changes to find the missing dependency and connect to it if it's created.
