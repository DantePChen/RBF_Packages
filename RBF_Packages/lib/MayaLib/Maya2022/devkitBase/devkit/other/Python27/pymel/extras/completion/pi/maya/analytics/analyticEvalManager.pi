If this file remains\n\t              in a directory after the analytic has run that means it was\n\t              interrupted and the data is not up to date.\n\t              \n\t              This file provides a safety measure against machines going down\n\t              or analytics crashing.\n\n\tname : Get the name of this type of analytic\n\n\toption : :param option: Name of option to check\n\t         :return: the current value of the named option\n\n\toutput_files : This is used to get the list of files the analytic will generate.\n\t               There will always be a JSON file generated which contains at minimum\n\t               the timing information. An analytic should override this method only\n\t               if they are adding more output files (e.g. a .jpg file).\n\t               \n\t               This should only be called after the final directory has been set.\n\n\trun : Run the analytic on the current scene.\n\t      :return: a JSON structure as described in the class doc\n\n\tset_options : Modify the settings controlling the run operation of the analytic.\n\t              Override this method if your analytic has some different options\n\t              available to it, but be sure to call this parent version after since\n\t              it sets common options.\n\t              \n\t              Note: Options are merged with existing options so make sure they are unique\n\t              :param options: Dictionary of OPTION:OPTION_VALUE to be set\n\n\tset_output_directory : Call this method to set a specific directory as the output location.\n\t                       The special names \'stdout\' and \'stderr\' are recognized as the\n\t                       output and error streams respectively rather than a directory.\n\n\twarning : Utility to standardize warnings coming from analytics.\n'
