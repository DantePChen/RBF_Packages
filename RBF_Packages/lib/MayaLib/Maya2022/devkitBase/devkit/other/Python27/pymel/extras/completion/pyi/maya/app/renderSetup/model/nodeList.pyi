"""
This module provides a base class for using nodes in linked lists as the
items in the list, as well as functions to modify a list of nodes.

The list management functions in this module that write to lists support
undo / redo.

Commands in this module should be considered private implementation
details, and should not be called by code outside this module.  Unfortunately,
there is no way to enforce this programmatically.  The following commands
are implemented in this module, and should not be called externally:

o removeListItem: remove a node item from a node list
o insertListItem: insert a node item before a given index position in a
                  node list.
o insertListItemBefore: insert a node item before another node item in a
                  node list.
o appendListItem: append a node item to a node list
o prependListItem: prepend a node item to a node list
o popListItem: remove and return the last node item from a node list

Maya commands do two things:

1) Support undo / redo
2) Support interactive execution through string argument parsing.

In this Python module, we are only interested in (1), as we have Python
objects that we can directly work with; converting them to string data to
pass to a command, which would need to convert them back to Python objects,
is wasteful and unnecessary.  This is because these commands are not meant
for interactive invocation, only for undo / redo purposes, and therefore
do not need interactive argument parsing.

Because of this, contrary to standard Maya commands, commands in this
module receive and take ownership of their data directly as Python objects,
on first execution.

In this context, overwriting an item means the caller has called this function twice with the same attribute, or that two separate but identically named attributes were used.

Returning any othervalue (including self) will tell Maya that this node successfully computed theplug. Raising an exception will tell Maya that this node failed at computingthe plug. Note that in most cases, Maya ignores node compute failures.
