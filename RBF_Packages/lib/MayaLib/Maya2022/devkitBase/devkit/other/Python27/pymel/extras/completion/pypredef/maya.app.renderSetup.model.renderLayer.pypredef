"""
This module provides the render layer class, as well as utility
functions to operate on render layers.


Note:
    In order to better control the update of the render layer, two flags were added 
    to each render layer instance to control the update of 1) the list of nodes owned
    by the legacy layer and 2) the rendering. The controls were introduced to avoid
    performance penalty on any user requests.
    
    The flag RenderLayer.needsMembershipUpdate is set to True when the list of nodes 
    part of the render layer changed meaning that the legacy layer must be updated. 
    The update is managed by an evalDeferred() so it will only be executed during 
    the next idle time. If an update is already planned, 
    the flag RenderLayer.isUpdatingMembership will be True. These flags only apply
    to the visible render layer. No updates are performed on the not visible ones.
    
    The flag RenderLayer.needsApplyUpdate is set to True when the rendering must be updated. 
    The default dirty mechanism of the scene is not enough as the render setup behavior implies
    to sometime apply or unapply some overrides. The first 'not optimized' implementation 
    of the rendering refresh is to impose a switchToLayer() 
    (i.e. unapply and apply all overrides). This flag only applies to the visible render layer. 
    No updates are performed on the not visible ones.
