"""
This file contains all the classes which implement the Qt Model needed to benefit from the
Model/View design from Qt.

The design intent is that these classes only be used to implement Qt views.
They should be used as proxies to the underlying render setup data model
objects only by Qt views code, and in such cases only with as little code
as is required to interface with Qt.

All other uses, by any other code, should use the render setup data
model interface directly.  It already provides an encapsulation of the
underlying Maya objects, as well as observation and notification
capability.  There is no need to duplicate render setup data model
interfaces and services in Qt model interfaces and services: this
is a maintenance burden, introduces the possibility of error, and
requires additional testing, for no gain.  Similarly, Qt model code
should not perform any render setup data model computation or abstraction;
such services must be implemented in the render setup data model layer.
