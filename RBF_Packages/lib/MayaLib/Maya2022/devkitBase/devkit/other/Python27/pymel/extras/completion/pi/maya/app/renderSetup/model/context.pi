"""
This module centralizes the treatment of applying/unapplying/updating 
layers/collections/overrides.

RenderLayers, Collections and Overrides are DG nodes they should technically be 
well-behaved, i.e. they should depend only on their local input attributes to 
compute consistently the same outputs.

In practice, they don't because some collections are traversing connections to 
populate their content and yet these connections may change because of 
previously applied overrides that will insert nodes in the unique global graph 
and/or edit connections in it. This module is tracking apply/unapply/connection 
override update in a global way (context) to insure that collection's content 
are correctly evaluated when they are applied.

Example: if we have something like this:

renderLayer1
  - collection1 with pSphere1
    - collection1_shaders1 gathering shaders assigned to pSphere1 (lambert1)
      - abs override color to yellow
    - materialOverride1 assigning blinn1 to pSphere1
    - collection1_shaders2 gathering shaders assigned to pSphere1 
      (blinn1 if materialOverrides is enabled, lambert1 otherwise)
      - abs override color to green

On apply, collection1_shaders2 must reevaluate its content depending on whether
or not materialOverride1 is enabled. On the other hand, collection1_shaders1 
remains unchanged because it is evaluated before materialOverride1.

This context module ensures that collection1_shaders1 doesn't listen to 
materialOverride1 (on apply, on enable/disable, on connection change) but 
collection1_shaders2 does. 

On apply: 
 > apply renderLayer1 
   > evaluate collection1 content
   > deactivate collection1's selector
   > apply collection1
     > evaluate collection1_shader1 content
     > deactivate collection1_shaders1's selector
     > apply collection1_shaders1
       > override lambert1's color to yellow
     > assign blinn1 to pSphere1
     > evaluate collection1_shader2 content
     > deactivate collection1_shaders2's selector
     > apply collection1_shaders2
       > override blinn1's color to green
   > reactivate all selectors from the first applied element (i.e. renderLayer1)

Now, if renderLayer1 is visible,
materialOverride1 update (enable/disable/connection changed) should:
 > create a PivotGuard on materialOverride1. This will deactivate all the 
   selectors BEFORE materialOverride1 but let the ones after activated.
 > update materialOverride1
 > look if a collection's selector AFTER that materialOverride1 was dirtied as
   they may need to reevaluate their content due to the connection change). 
   In this case, collection1_shaders2 selector will have been dirtied.
   It will then create a PivotGuard around collection1_shaders2 and reapply 
   the partially reapply the layer with that pivot collection.
   The PivotGuard guarantees that collection1 and collection1_shaders1 selectors
   are deactivated and protect these collections from being unapplied/reapplied, 
   since they would remain unchanged anyway.
