"""
Each collection object has a selector that is responsible for determining
objects that:

o are members of the render layer, and
o will be overridden.

The property editor supports different UIs for different selector
types.  The property editor selector factory provides an extensible
mechanism to create the UI for various selector types.

To create a property editor UI for a selector class, a creator callable
is registered on the data model selector class type.  On creation, the
creator callable is given the data model selector object.

The return value of the creator is a builder object for the selector
property UI.  This object must have a build() method, whose argument is
the property editor UI layout for the selector.

The selector factory is a singleton.
