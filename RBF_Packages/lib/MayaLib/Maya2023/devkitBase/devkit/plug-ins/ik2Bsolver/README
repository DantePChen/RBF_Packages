The IK two bone solver (ik2Bsolver) is a lightweight IK solver
designed for use in real-time applications.  This IK solver solves for
2 bones with rotate plane capacity.  For more information on using the
IK solver please refer to the Maya user documentation:
    "Using IK Two Bone Handles"

In order to make it easy to use the solveIK function outside of Maya,
we have written it as much as possible to be independent of
Maya-specific code.  To accomplish that, we have provided the source
code for the math classes and methods that the IK solver uses.  These
classes are named:  AwPoint, AwVector, AwMatrix, and AwQuaternion, and
are used in the plug-in in the places that would otherwise have used
Maya's built in math classes: MPoint, MVector, MMatrix, and
MQuaternion.
