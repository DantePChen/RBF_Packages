    compare_translate : Comparison for a DAG node's translation values
    compare_rotate    : Comparison for a DAG node's rotation values
    compare_scale     : Comparison for a DAG node's scale values
    compare_floats    : Generic comparison for float values

Each method returns a closeness measurement indicating how equal the values are.
The measurement is the log10 of the average  of the numbers divided by the
difference, with values near zero being treated as completely equal. Larger values
are a closer match.

    ALL_SIGNIFICANT_DIGITS_MATCH : Indicates the numbers are functionally identical
    NO_SIGNIFICANT_DIGITS_MATCH  : Indicates the numbers are complete different
    DEFAULT_SIGNIFICANT_DIGITS   : A good first guess at a reasonable closeness measure

The closeness of a list of values equals the closeness of the worst match in the list.
e.g. [0.0,0.0,1.0] will be completely unmatched by [0.0,0.0,0.5] even though two of the
     three values are the same.
