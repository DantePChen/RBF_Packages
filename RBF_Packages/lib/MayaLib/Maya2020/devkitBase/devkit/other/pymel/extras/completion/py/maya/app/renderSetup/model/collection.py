"""
This module provides the collection class, as well as utility
functions to operate on collections.

The collection owns its associated selector node: on collection
delete, the collection is deleted as well.

Conceptually, a collection fulfills four roles in render setup:

1) It is a container of overrides.  If enabled, the collection will
   apply all its enabled overrides on nodes it selects (see (2)).
2) It selects nodes onto which overrides will be applied.  These nodes
   can be DAG or DG nodes.
3) It is a container of child collections.  Child collections always
   select nodes based on their parent's selected nodes (see (2)).
4) It defines render layer membership.  Members of a render layer can
   only be DAG nodes.  These are always a subset of the nodes selected
   by the collection (see (2)).  The members of the render layer are the
   union of the top-level collection members; children collections can
   exclude or re-include members.  See RenderLayer.getMembers for more
   details (including the effect of isolate select mode).

The application of overrides only obeys enabled / disabled status.

Render layer membership is determined from enabled / disabled, in
conjunction with isolate select.
